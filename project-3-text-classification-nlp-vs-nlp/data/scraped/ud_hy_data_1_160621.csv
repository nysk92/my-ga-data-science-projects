,hypnosis,"I've been training in hypnotherapy online and am trying to decide whether to go into practice or not.  So bear with me for being a hassle and I wonder people's opinion.

Or have I?  Hypnosis is interesting, maybe I need to lighten up and roll with it, and when I get good and see changes happening in people, questions will answer themselves...

Here is why I have doubt:

* It seems like a lot of the psychology associated is heavily bullshit or at minimum ridiculously simplistic.  If you compare something like the Jungian view of the mind with the idea that it's all just beliefs for you to go in and change...  It all feels pretty cringe.
* Some of the techniques, like parts negotiation, really strike me as bullshit.  Or at least the official explanation.  Am I really talking to a part of the person's mind directly?  Seems to me unlikely and again pretty cringe.
* Overall my class has a cultish character and is populated by people who generally seem ready to glom onto any superficial healing technique with no evidence / tradition / logic behind it.  If you question anything, they get upset at you for being negative.  I feel we're all constantly ""treating"" each other and giving each other pats on the back and nothing much happens.  Don't get me wrong, I am an occultist, I just don't like my wackiness to be superficial or MLM.
* Fwiw, I've been quite down, and keep having people try to hypnotize me not to be down, and tell me that since I still am, I must not want to change, so that's really soured me on this.

On the other hand:

\* I know hypnosis works well for things like smoking &amp; weight control, and it seems logical that it would, basically you just need a little persuasive, imagine it differently push.

* OK, hypnosis is real, so I guess one could just do it and use a different patter that feels less cringe and bullshit?  Maybe I just need to find different techniques, different teachers that resonate better with my beliefs or work on developing my own styles &amp; skill?
* Maybe I'm focusing too much on whether the theories are true and just should focus on that they work and it doesn't really matter why, it's good enough that the person believes the talking hand puppet is their mind part and let's themselves make a wanted change.

&lt;li&gt;OK, hypnosis is real, so I guess one could just do it and use a different patter that feels less cringe and bullshit?  Maybe I just need to find different techniques, different teachers that resonate better with my beliefs or work on developing my own styles &amp;amp; skill?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m focusing too much on whether the theories are true and just should focus on that they work and it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter why, it&amp;#39;s good enough that the person believes the talking hand puppet is their mind part and let&amp;#39;s themselves make a wanted change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I’m really grateful for everyone’s comments.  It’s great to get this perspective.  I wish I’d come on long ago to broaden my horizons&lt;/p&gt;

- How long did it roughly take? How you increased your ""body count""? Free too, not only paying clients.

- Did you make your certifications first or did you experiment paralel with education?

- Did you specialised on treating something or you were more generalist type of business?

,hypnosis,"I'm hoping to overcome my insomina with hypnosis, but I don't know where to begin.

PROBLEM: I've dealt with insomnia for 10+ years (anxiety is the cause). My insomnia was very bad in my mid-20s, but I started using meditation and CBT techniques before bed, and that helped mitigate things. About a year ago, I was able to fall asleep within 10-15 mins. 

Now, however, it's 30-45 mins. And I go through this annoying ritual where I take half a melatonin tablet, lie down, get up to meditate, use the bathroom, take the other half of the melatonin tablet, lie down again, get up to meditate again, use the bathroom again, and finally fall asleep.

Most recently I've been waking up early and struggling to get back to sleep (usually I try meditating again). This is killing me, as it's costing me 1-2 hours of sleep.

NEED HELP: I'm not sure where to start with hypnosis. I've seen people recommend books on self-hypnosis, YouTube videos, and hypnotherapy sessions. Not sure what to try first. Would listening to a YouTube hypnosis video before bed (or while lying in bed) be a good start?

I used with both a handshake interruption but the sceptical one didn&amp;#39;t give me his hand before being able to understand what was happening, and I think he was trying to understand the experience he was living during the deepening, without analyzing it though.

What would this persons mind be like at 7am Saturday.

Are there any clinical papers that present what this persons state of mind would be?

,hypnosis,"Hi,

I’m a big believer in hypnosis and have used self-hypnosis CDs in the past which I found had worked.  
I went to a professional hypnotherapist a few months ago, to get a couple of specific goals (both different areas) for one session.   
They didn’t use a script and it felt very general. I did feel a bit different afterwards and had a bit of extra motivation. However, it wasn’t long before I was questioning the session due to the lack of script. 

Fast forward to present and I’m really questioning if it was a waste of time. I have read that experienced hypnotherapists don’t need to read a script and have heard one hypnotherapist say the subconscious already knows what to do. 

I guess my expectation was that a script was used to reprogram my mind regarding my aims, and then I’d get a recording to use for 21 days. 

I don’t feel my blocks have been removed, I can especially tell with one of my issues, my thinking hasn’t progressed at all and I’m no better off than before the session.

,hypnosis,"I see this question come up a lot so I thought I'd answer it. I use the Elman induction in my recordings that I make for myself because it is quick and easy.  In the Elman Induction there are 5 steps. I'll go over those now and how to incorporate them into your recordings (note that this can be shortened for more experienced people and that this is an excessively long Elman intro).

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Eye relaxation** \- during this step you are instructing yourself to relax your eyes. It will look something like the following, ""\[find a comfortable position etc.\] and when you are ready, simply close your eyes. In a moment I'll count from 3 to 1 and with each number relax your eyes and eyelids deeper. Starting with 3, feel all the muscles around your eyes start to relax and release their tension. 2, noticing your eyelids becoming still, and noting that if they are still moving, it is a sign of them trying to relax, and that is a good sign. And 1, not worrying about any movement that might be left, and having confidence that with each breath out you take your eye lids relax more and more.  
""Now notice that quality of relaxation, and know that if you keep that quality of relaxation you simply won't be able to open them.  And if you want to now, go ahead and try to open them and notice that even as you try to open them you can easily hold that quality of relaxation, and if you do, they simply cannot open.'  
... or something like that.
2. **Body Relaxation** \- This is super easy and quick. It goes something like, ""And now, you might find it easy to imagine that relaxation spread all throughout your body. That's right, with each breath out now you could imagine it spreading further down your body, down your arms... your chest... into your abdomen... through your legs. Completely relaxed.
3. **Fractionation** \- This is exactly the same as a usual Elman (albeit without waving hands and such). Something like, ""And in a moment your going to greatly deepen your relaxation, because when I say 'open your eyes' you'll let your eyes open, and when I say 'shut your eyes,' you'll let them close again, but as you let them close you'll double your relaxation, and go down twice as deep. Ready? Open you eyes \[count 1.. 2..\] and close them. Doubling that relaxation, and feeling yourself travel deeper down. \[Pause\] and again... \[then do the process two more times\].
4. **Arm Drop Deepener** \- This is where things get tricky.  There are two things happening here. First, this step is a deepener. Secondly, it is a convincer. Finally, it is a test to check for muscle catalepsy. *Because you have first hand information about whether you're completely relaxed, it is not needed, but replaced with something else*.  Here are my suggestions. Firstly, you could do a **staircase deepener**. Super easy, but do a good one.  These are tricky to learn to do well and I'm happy to do another post on that. Better yet, do an **arm stick** test. Basic steps are to tell yourself to imagine now something warm and sticky spreading along your hand, flowing all around, even under your fingers. The more it flows, the more it sticks until  you hand starts to feel really stuck. Then instruct yourself to give a *little* test to see how your fingers feel stuck. If that works, intensify the stickiness, spread it up the arm, and then go for a bigger test.... 'and now relax...' Don't forget to unstick and go back to relaxation.  
If this is done well you've done your own convincer and test. If it doesn't, do a few more PMR scripts on youtube for practice and then try again.
5. **Suggested Amnesia** \- This is the straightforward. I would do something like this, ""And now that your body is completely relaxed, and with each breath out relaxing more deeply still, it might be nice for your mind to enter a similar state of relaxation. So in a moment you can start counting slowly backwards from 100.  And with each number you mind can grow more relaxed, more serene. And as your mind grows more relaxed, it might become more and more difficult to recall what comes next, and that is a good sign that your mind it becoming more relaxed, until those numbers just fade away. So in a moment I'm going to give you some time to relax your mind counting backwards from 100 until all those numbers are gone.  Now, shortly I'll start talking again, and when I do you'll know that you can take that as a sign to relax more deeply still, but right now start counting backwards from 100 \[wait 30-60 seconds\].

And that's it.  I would then move into the suggestion phase.  It would go something like this. 'As you find yourself now, continuing to drift downward in this peaceful state you can easily notice that your subconscious mind is more receptive to authentic ideas and deeper levels of meaning, because you've chosen to come to this place and this state, and to make positive change. \[etc\]

And 1, not worrying about any movement that might be left, and having confidence that with each breath out you take your eye lids relax more and more.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;Now notice that quality of relaxation, and know that if you keep that quality of relaxation you simply won&amp;#39;t be able to open them.  And if you want to now, go ahead and try to open them and notice that even as you try to open them you can easily hold that quality of relaxation, and if you do, they simply cannot open.&amp;#39;&lt;br/&gt;
... or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body Relaxation&lt;/strong&gt; - This is super easy and quick. It goes something like, &amp;quot;And now, you might find it easy to imagine that relaxation spread all throughout your body. That&amp;#39;s right, with each breath out now you could imagine it spreading further down your body, down your arms... your chest... into your abdomen... through your legs. Completely relaxed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fractionation&lt;/strong&gt; - This is exactly the same as a usual Elman (albeit without waving hands and such). Something like, &amp;quot;And in a moment your going to greatly deepen your relaxation, because when I say &amp;#39;open your eyes&amp;#39; you&amp;#39;ll let your eyes open, and when I say &amp;#39;shut your eyes,&amp;#39; you&amp;#39;ll let them close again, but as you let them close you&amp;#39;ll double your relaxation, and go down twice as deep. Ready? Open you eyes [count 1.. 2..] and close them. Doubling that relaxation, and feeling yourself travel deeper down. [Pause] and again... [then do the process two more times].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arm Drop Deepener&lt;/strong&gt; - This is where things get tricky.  There are two things happening here. First, this step is a deepener. Secondly, it is a convincer. Finally, it is a test to check for muscle catalepsy. &lt;em&gt;Because you have first hand information about whether you&amp;#39;re completely relaxed, it is not needed, but replaced with something else&lt;/em&gt;.  Here are my suggestions. Firstly, you could do a &lt;strong&gt;staircase deepener&lt;/strong&gt;. Super easy, but do a good one.  These are tricky to learn to do well and I&amp;#39;m happy to do another post on that. Better yet, do an &lt;strong&gt;arm stick&lt;/strong&gt; test. Basic steps are to tell yourself to imagine now something warm and sticky spreading along your hand, flowing all around, even under your fingers. The more it flows, the more it sticks until  you hand starts to feel really stuck. Then instruct yourself to give a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; test to see how your fingers feel stuck. If that works, intensify the stickiness, spread it up the arm, and then go for a bigger test.... &amp;#39;and now relax...&amp;#39; Don&amp;#39;t forget to unstick and go back to relaxation.&lt;br/&gt;
If this is done well you&amp;#39;ve done your own convincer and test. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, do a few more PMR scripts on youtube for practice and then try again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggested Amnesia&lt;/strong&gt; - This is the straightforward. I would do something like this, &amp;quot;And now that your body is completely relaxed, and with each breath out relaxing more deeply still, it might be nice for your mind to enter a similar state of relaxation. So in a moment you can start counting slowly backwards from 100.  And with each number you mind can grow more relaxed, more serene. And as your mind grows more relaxed, it might become more and more difficult to recall what comes next, and that is a good sign that your mind it becoming more relaxed, until those numbers just fade away. So in a moment I&amp;#39;m going to give you some time to relax your mind counting backwards from 100 until all those numbers are gone.  Now, shortly I&amp;#39;ll start talking again, and when I do you&amp;#39;ll know that you can take that as a sign to relax more deeply still, but right now start counting backwards from 100 [wait 30-60 seconds].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it.  I would then move into the suggestion phase.  It would go something like this. &amp;#39;As you find yourself now, continuing to drift downward in this peaceful state you can easily notice that your subconscious mind is more receptive to authentic ideas and deeper levels of meaning, because you&amp;#39;ve chosen to come to this place and this state, and to make positive change. [etc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that helps people. Elman is super easy and pretty quick. Once you know your expectations and the process you can shorten this script accordingly. Feel free to ask me questions about my process, recording setup, etc...&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"

Hello all.
I've been lurking on here for a while but never posted. I prefer to observe and research and never really felt I had anything to add. I hesitated to make this thread for a few weeks as it's just a repeat of so many others, but I need some advice if anyone is willing.

I've been on somewhat of a journey over the last few years. I'm trying to address mental health concerns that have reduced my quality of life for a long time. My therapist suggested I branch out into modalities beyond just CBT in hopes of finding tools that may be more effective. I decided to pursue hypnosis among other things as it's been something I found interesting since childhood.
I'm sure you've probably guessed already where this is going, but I'm not having any meaningful success. I've listened to dozens of hours of audio from a variety of different creators, and have seen two separate licensed Hypnotherapists. My results have been disappointing, frustrating, and at times downright depressing.

The Hypnotherapists were not great experiences. The first was a woman who was friendly enough, but didn't really seem that engaged. Her inductions and therapy were repetitive, and when I struggled to reach any kind of useful trance state she seemed  to give up. She recommended I try a different therapist who may have a different approach than her. Fair enough.
The second was more frustrating. He was very engaged and excited to do his job, but again I struggled to reach any kind of useful state. Rather than recognize this, he insisted each time that I'd been hypnotized and everything was exactly as it should be. I found this hard to accept as I'd continually failed every convincer and depth test, and experienced nothing different from simply closing my eyes and thinking about something. His insistence started to diminish our rapport after several sessions, and eventually I decided I couldn't justify paying his rate for what amounted to little more than someone telling me to close my eyes and use my imagination. He seemed offended at the end, and believed it was my subconscious telling me to quit as a means of resisting change. If that was true, I'm sorry to say my subconscious was successful.

I've since spent months researching the topic and trying to accomplish what I can on my own. I can say I have accomplished much more from determination and repetition than I was ever able to experience with the therapists. Unfortunately, I've hit a wall that I can't seem to pass. I believe I'm achieving a light trance state at times with certain audio recordings, but it's difficult and not always reliable. I've yet to experience a single instance of hypnotic phenomena, and the suggestibility just doesn't seem to be there. I recognize the telltale signs of trance, but the internal experiences are neither vivid nor realistic in any way.
I believe there is still hope though. At times I do seem to lose myself in a level of engagement and focus, but it never lasts for more than a second or two. Trying to go beyond a certain level of focus or depth seems to trigger a reflex that causes me to pull back from what's happening. I've been trying to relax and allow myself to move forward for quite some time, but this jolt seems as reliable a reflex as a doctor's tap to your knee, and is just as involuntary.

I've invested a lot of time and effort into this, and it's a tool I would very dearly like to have. If nothing else, it's an experience I want that's been out of my reach. I recognize overlap with other areas of my life that I'm struggling with and I really do believe a breakthrough on this would have significant benefit for me. I'm not sure how to address this though. I would be very sad to have to accept defeat and give up on ever experiencing this, but if that's the reality of the situation then it is what it is I suppose.
If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read all of this. Any advice, suggestions, or musings are welcome and appreciated. I feel like I need a new approach, but I'm at a loss for what that could be.

,hypnosis,"I'll try and sum this up. I think I've got the the gist of self-hypnosis after the many books I've collected (didn't read even a quarter of them lol) and I've also practiced and gotten into trance quite a few times. I'd say I know how to get into now.

So I've got social anxiety and I want to get rid of it. I thought about what I want from it, not what I don't and the traits I want are: great confidence, self-esteem, popularity (in school), humour. I also want to be a great people person and have a ""don't give a fuck"" type of attitude when it comes to saying what's on my mind (could this one be bad? I don't want to come off as rude. Just want to stop having second thoughts and overthinking everything).

Normally I'd repeat some suggestions in my head for things that I want in myself, while in trance, but that's when I'm focused on one topic. So what I'm asking is does anyone have any useful suggestions in mind and would it be bad to be repeating them all in each session? You know, since there's quite a lot I want.

I think I&amp;#39;ve got the the gist of self-hypnosis after the many books I&amp;#39;ve collected (didn&amp;#39;t read even a quarter of them lol) and I&amp;#39;ve also practiced and gotten into trance quite a few times. I&amp;#39;d say I know how to get into now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve got social anxiety and I want to get rid of it. I thought about what I want from it, not what I don&amp;#39;t and the traits I want are: great confidence, self-esteem, popularity (in school), humour. I also want to be a great people person and have a &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t give a fuck&amp;quot; type of attitude when it comes to saying what&amp;#39;s on my mind (could this one be bad? I don&amp;#39;t want to come off as rude. Just want to stop having second thoughts and overthinking everything).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I&amp;#39;d repeat some suggestions in my head for things that I want in myself, while in trance, but that&amp;#39;s when I&amp;#39;m focused on one topic. So what I&amp;#39;m asking is does anyone have any useful suggestions in mind and would it be bad to be repeating them all in each session? You know, since there&amp;#39;s quite a lot I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanna know this because I wanna start working on myself ASAP since this social anxiety has been really affecting me lately and I&amp;#39;ve been feeling worse. It hurts to want to socialise but keep getting held back.&lt;/p&gt;

As your eyes focussing on mobile screen,   
They feel more relaxed and relaxed.  
  
Take a minute and observe it.  
  
As eyes getting relaxed, wondering how bright is mobile screen.  
  
As you wonder, your inner and outer aspects of legs relax deeply and more.  
  
That's right. Take a moment to appreciate it.  
   
Though your eyes are on screen, your mental focus is on relaxed legs.    
  
Take a minute. And feel it.

I had another past relationship with another girl, And she was super close to getting raped by a stranger. She got lucky, I was there on phone, and we were able to send him to Jail.

After that incident, she had panic issues. And asked me to help her to forget about it but keep the fear just to protect herself and avoid such situations.

The hypnosis session was successful and it worked. But I did something stupid again.

I accidentally quoted a message from the past that related to that past incident, and she clicked on it and went through the conversation which I made her forget by a hypnosis session.

Suddenly she grabbed her head and started to scream out loud saying ""My head hurts...! Please help me...! help me...!!""

I noticed what happened, then I was able to hypnotize her fast, She managed to focus on my words somehow while having the pain in her head, and I made her forget what she recently read, and erased all chats, that's how she got back to normal.

,hypnosis,"I've been gone for a while due to being busy, but recently I revisited some topics tangentially related to hypnosis, and it's led me to reconsider my stance on how the fast phobia cure works. I thought I'd share with you guys, because FPC has been discussed several times here and I think often the discussion was extremely terse and it was sometimes hard to tell what points exactly people were trying to make (and I'm not excluding myself from this). So, here's more detail than anyone ever asked for.

**My model of the mind in a nutshell**

I view all cognitive patterns as chains of associations, roughly speaking. Any stimulus – internal or external – gets mixed together with all of the current ""state"" (what's in your working set and radius of perception), weighted by how relevant/notable it is deemed by your mind, and then a rapid search gets kicked off that finds all ""matching"" associations - again, weighted by relevance. These then get activated automatically. They might be memories, thoughts, emotions, ...

The difficulty in any naive attempt of getting rid of an unwanted association is that every time you trigger it, all of the existing associations come up immediately, and whatever you want to happen instead couldn't possibly have enough of an association weight in your mind to compete with any of that. Logically, there are two ways to work around that: either make the new thing ""powerful"" (= strong emotions) enough to compete, or find a way to temporarily bypass the existing associations, so you can start building up the new association in the absence of serious competitors.

Of course, in any real world scenario, this is rather more complex than this very simple description makes it appear, due to the sheer number of stimuli and associations, and the number of links in a chain of associations.

Furthermore, as seems apparent from the study of mindfulness, a chain will always get drowned out by the default mode network or other stimuli eventually, unless the chain reinforces itself (""loops""). I believe that this happens because of meta-cognition (you read something into your inner experience that reinforces it). Mindfulness, then, works by biasing the meta-cognition away from what it does to keep the loop going, but anything else that interrupts the meta-cognition should stop the loop in the present moment, too.

Contrived and vastly simplified example: suppose you're afraid of waffles. You spot one and that kicks off a fear response. You think ""I need to stop feeling this but I can't, omigosh"" and that focuses you even more on the fear, amplifying it. In a sense, you bounce back and forth between being aware of your fear and ""cognizing"" that you can't control it. The key insight for mindfulness is that while you probably can't ""turn off"" the feeling, you *can* interpret it differently. If you can *congruently* think to yourself, ""I'm feeling this powerful fear now, but it will fade soon"", that eliminates the amplifying factor. In fact as soon as you can believe it (e.g. because you've practiced mindfulness on ever more powerful cognitive responses), it becomes a self-fulfilling suggestion to yourself.

Now, this makes mindfulness a viable solution to get rid of any conditioning, but most likely not an instant one. Generally, I believe it will serve to ""train away"" the meta-cognition that reinforces the unwanted pattern - but it does not directly eliminate the initial trigger of the cognitive chain. For instance, a phobia of waffles always kicks in if the concept of a waffle enters your present mental state, and that will immediately fire up a fear response. That fear response doesn't stick around if you break the meta-cognition that keeps it looping around, but that only makes it fade out while you do that. Over (some amount of) time, as you keep doing that, the fear will fade out more easily and that will contribute to the overall response fading, too, until the waffle only makes you remember that you used to be afraid, if anything.

This is not what the FPC seems to be doing - it seems to be rather more rapid (and still quite permanent). So what's going on?

**On FPC as backward conditioning**

I've seen here, several times, the notion that the fast phobia cure is ""just backward conditioning"". I don't think this is a good explanation of what's going on, nor ""true"" in any meaningful way.

I believe this is based on an overly formulaic application of what is known about classical conditioning and backward conditioning. Let's revisit the basics really quickly.

Classical conditioning: pair a conditioned stimulus (CS) which is typically neutral with an unconditioned stimulus (US) which is typically ""potent"" and has a pre-existing unconditioned response (UR). The conditioning process, especially if repeated, results in a conditioned response (CR) to the CS that is often similar to the UR (but doesn't have to be - at which point you can start wondering if the formula is maybe a little incomplete).

In short: CS+(US+UR) = CS+CR

When pairing the two stimuli, usually the CS comes first, then the US; this is called forward conditioning. If you turn it around - US first, then CS, three things can happen: either the conditioning is reinforced, it is not significantly affected, or it is diminished. A quick survey of the literature finds that reinforcement is dubious, and both neutral and diminishing results are possible. At least one study that tried to nail this down further found that only if you restrict your trials to traditional Pavlovian conditioning (where the US is a potent biological stimulus rather than a purely cognitive object), you consistently get inhibition.

The problem is that almost nothing about phobias is Pavlovian. The fear response is the only ""biologically potent"" element in the equation, and it's not present as a stimulus, but as the response. And more generally, what exactly do US, UR, CS and CR map to in a phobia? I suppose CS is seeing the waffle, CR is the fear response... but what is represented by US and UR? For the sake of this discussion, let's assume the phobia developed because a waffle bit you and it was extremely painful (and let's not talk about the fact that many people get bitten by waffles without developing a phobia, because then we'd have to face the fact that phobias are a little more complicated than this). The pain, then, is a biologically potent response, so it can serve as the UR. Then, maybe the bite is the US. It's really the only thing I can think of if we try to map this whole thing out as purely Pavlovian.

Backward conditioning, in the only form that has been found to work more or less consistently, then, would require biting someone without having them see (or think of) a waffle. That doesn't really look like a FPC to me...

I mean, we all *have* to agree that there is something going on on a cognitive level, because classical conditioning is known to extinguish if you repeatedly present someone with the CS without the US going on. On a purely behaviourist level, only the bite could possibly be the US, but the phobia will keep going even if the person is never bitten by a waffle again. In other words, the conditioning that makes a phobia work definitely involves conditioning on a cognitive level (CS and CR are cognitively constructed), otherwise it wouldn't survive a bunch of waffles that don't bite. Now, if you want to argue that the FPC is essentially backward conditioning *but* on a cognitive level, I'm afraid that science doesn't really back you up on that. There are solid findings for Pavlovian backward conditioning resulting in extinction, but not for ""non-Pavlovian"" (cognitive) backward conditioning – at least I could not find any.

Does the FPC result in extinction? It certainly seems so! But not due to backward conditioning, if you ask me.

**On FPC as ""reversing pathways""**

This is one I've seen several times in NLP materials. Basically the claim is that the temporal reversal magically undoes the existing chain of associations. I am entirely unconvinced.

But let's assume for a moment that it's true - that reversing a sequence somehow neutralizes the original from the mind, removing the energy and emotion and stuff. By that logic, if I'm a member of a band and I'm performing live on stage, I should probably never leave the stage again, because it's the reverse of entering the stage! Next time I go on stage I won't be able to feel the anticipation anymore because it has been neutralized. I may never again enjoy a stage performance...

If you think that this is a ridiculous example, of course you're right... but I think it's just barely not-ridiculous enough to illustrate a little snag: reversals of sequences happen so often in everyday life that all of us would have noticed a significant effect by now if they were somehow magical. (To the people who have used VHS tapes – did rewinding a tape ever seem to unexpectedly ruin all the rewatchings for you?)

**Let's try again...**

So, what *does* the FPC do? Recall that by my model, there are two ways to change a powerful association: somehow inhibit the existing associations (e.g. *external inhibition* in conditioning lingo) or hype up the new association.

There isn't really any noticeable hyping up in the FPC, but there is an inhibitory element, and it's the key of what makes the FPC work: dissociation (typically using the ""movie hall"" frame). By dissociating from the experience as it ""plays out"", you distance yourself from your normal conditioned responses. There's a reason some traumatized people dissociate quite extensively as a way to cope with ongoing pressure – it works!

What's more: this shifts the meta-cognition, too. If you actually do dissociate from the experience, your actual experience is something different, it's basically trying to see yourself from the outside. This is so much of a shift from the original sequence of events that it's virtually impossible to also focus on what your inner state was like back then (you couldn't congruently do that while not being associated with your inner experience at the time), which means you are ""technically"" experiencing the thing from back then but without feeling what you felt, and to an extent even without seeing what you saw etc., because you're observing yourself (or even observing yourself watching the situation – it doesn't get much more dissociated than that) – the whole original chain of cognitive activity is just not happening.

So, you now have an extremely weakened form of the terrible waffle bite experience ""active"" in your mind – it doesn't seem like that would be any use, but apparently it is enough to get the reconditioning started: we have an entry point to the phobia close by.

Next, to actually transform the original phobic response, we need to somehow keep the ability to stay distanced from the old response but re-associate with the experience. That's where the super speed rewind comes in: you're associated but the experience is so scrambled (by reversal) and compressed (by the speed of the rewind) that it's difficult to get the original response fired up in your mind… and you barely have time to respond before the rewind is over. If you repeat the same thing again, it will be even easier because you've just practiced it – and only a smidgeon of the response popped up, so you already know it's much, much easier than facing your phobia head on. Another repeat and it starts feeling completely un-phobic and purely ridiculous.

Jumping through all of these hoops, we have basically forged a new chain of sorts: first we separated the experience from the phobic response, then we transferred that into an extremely distorted version of the original trigger – which is seemingly enough to make it work and attach this new chain consisting of ""experience the trigger – feel neutral or even a little silly"".

So, if anyone feels like they absolutely *need* to argue that the FPC is not original to NLP, my suggestion is you look at it as a particularly funky way to do external inhibition. Unfortunately, if you do this, you might start wondering if hypnosis isn't just external inhibition, too (particularly if you can agree with Erickson's concept of ""depotentiating habitual conscious sets""), and then you'd potentially end up concluding that all of hypnosis is ""just relabeled classical conditioning stuff"", too... and that would mean we could close down this subreddit because we've just been doing regular science things that everyone already knows about...

&lt;p&gt;Jumping through all of these hoops, we have basically forged a new chain of sorts: first we separated the experience from the phobic response, then we transferred that into an extremely distorted version of the original trigger – which is seemingly enough to make it work and attach this new chain consisting of &amp;quot;experience the trigger – feel neutral or even a little silly&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if anyone feels like they absolutely &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to argue that the FPC is not original to NLP, my suggestion is you look at it as a particularly funky way to do external inhibition. Unfortunately, if you do this, you might start wondering if hypnosis isn&amp;#39;t just external inhibition, too (particularly if you can agree with Erickson&amp;#39;s concept of &amp;quot;depotentiating habitual conscious sets&amp;quot;), and then you&amp;#39;d potentially end up concluding that all of hypnosis is &amp;quot;just relabeled classical conditioning stuff&amp;quot;, too... and that would mean we could close down this subreddit because we&amp;#39;ve just been doing regular science things that everyone already knows about...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"Hello all,

I was wondering If anyone of you could help me out here. I am not a hypnotist so I don't have the knowledge, how to go about this. I have
read this text below in a forum post. I am currently watching hypnosis
DVDs with a buddy. And basically have instructed him to learn as much
as possible about this topic. The goal is that my buddy will bring me
into hypnosis and install trance triggers. Some redditors would
probably suggest me to go to a professional hypnotist. But I would
like to do it this way for now.

This text below tells about placing trance triggers for the purpose of
conjuring hypnotic phenomena at will. The author also talks about
fractionation. I know what fractionation is, but to use it how the
author described is a bit unclear for me at the moment.

¨Then ask them to install trance triggers that drop you into open-eyed
somnambulism.¨

As far I know somnambulism is a deep state of hypnosis. So what I
guessing is that the hypnotist should bring/guide a subject into a
very deep state of hypnosis. Then I would imagine that the hypnotist
must tell the subject to open his eyes, but also give a suggestion
that when the subject opens his eyes he will stay in trance. (I have
read that when subjects open their eyes they can go out of the
hypnotic trance.) When the subject has opened his eyes and is still
in a very deep state. A suggestion should be made such as when the
subject says ¨key trigger word¨ he instantly goes back to that hypnotic
trance state. (probably the subject should be taken out of trance to
test if the trigger works)

¨Make them test the trance trigger so you are really in state and can
really see hallucinatory objects in front of you, or not see things
you’re told not to see.¨

I guess the hypnotist should bring the subject fully out of hypnosis
with the normal exduction technique. (by the count of 5 you will be
fully awake feeling energized refreshed and alert ect…)
And then the subject should test this newly installed trance trigger.
I am suspecting that when the subject tests the trance trigger while
still being in a very deep state of hypnosis. It will not be the
correct measuring point.

¨They may have to fractionate you a dozen times or more to
lock this trigger in.¨

I really have no clue how to go about this one, I know what
fractionation is and how to do the fractionation technique. But I don't
know how to fractionate a trance trigger.

Can someone tell me if I'm on the right track and if necessary correct
my assumptions and can somebody tell me how to fractionate trance
triggers?

Also, I would like to know, that when a subject is in a very deep state
of hypnosis. Would he automatically be able to visualize hallucinatory
objects? or should a suggestion be made? Such as ¨and now from this
moment you will be able to project visualizations¨ (the purpose here
is not a passive state of hallucinations, the purpose is to actively
project/create hallucinatory visualizations) i.e the subject projects
a mental image of a floating bottle of water and will see with open
eyes in front of him a floating bottle of water.

,hypnosis,"Hi All,

Okay, I want to know more about the mechanics of fractionation. What I know about hypnosis is that it's an altered state of mind. There are different depths of hypnosis. Light (Alpha)   Medium (Theta)   Deep (delta)

I read that somebody posted that frequently going in and out of trance will deepen the trance state. The person also said that one should go from Beta to Theta and back to Beta. 

I am working with my Light-Sound-Machine (LSM), and what I have learned is that the entrainment process takes around 6 minutes. While the change of Hz should be around 1Hz per minute. Example: starting from Beta 13Hz going to low Theta 4,5Hz should take at least 8,5 minutes. + 6 minutes of additional entrainment. 

I recently saw a lecture about hypnosis in which the speaker spoke about fractionation. In which he said that every time someone is taken out of trance, the subject will be less alert and still be a bit in the trance state. So that means that the subject will not be in Beta.

So that is conflicting information, one person says to deepen a trance state, a person should go from Beta to Theta and back to Beta. While another person says that a subject will not fully enter Beta when doing the Fractionation. (Probably Theta-Alpha-Theta)

Secondly working and reading about the LSM, I have learned that it takes ""a bit"" of time to change the frequency of the brainwave. But with some hypnosis videos, I saw on Youtube a Hypnotist would Fractionate a person within a timeframe of a few seconds. 

Could someone shed some light on this topic in regards to the two things I mentioned here above?",t2_7q3d69w5,False,,0,False,How does fractionation work?,[],r/hypnosis,False,6,,0,,False,t3_nb6h6k,False,dark,0.73,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1620902380.0,text,6,,,text,self.hypnosis,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"Hello everyone, I’m looking for feedback and advice from the hive mind. Last night I had my first successful hypnosis attempt... or at least semi-successful. 

Before trance I did a couple of susceptiblity tests and she didn’t do too well (though I didn’t tell her that). Finger vice got no response, but we did have a little success with the balloon/sand arm raise/lower exercise. This kind of tracked with her assertion that she was a difficult subject (experience in her past told her this).

My parter suffered from ADD, so I used a rapid induction (hand drop) and managed to get her into trance with it. She popped out right out because I was so surprised I froze (facepalm). 

On the next attempt I managed to do better, I didn’t freeze, I kept talking and she seemed to stay under. I moved onto the staircase deepener, and bumbled my way through it. Afterwards I did the arm flop test, followed by arm and eye catalepsy tests and all three went off without a hitch.

I followed this up with a few sets of fractionation which seemed to do ok. Now comes the reason for the “semi” in my success: I attempted to give her a reinduction trigger. In trace, she accepted it, I worded it will and it should have worked... but when I pulled her out to test it, nothing... not even an eye flutter...

Things I learned, is that she responds well to visual and kinesthetic input, so I’ll try and work those in. I also plan to try out different deepeners, like the blackboard deepener incase I have more success than the staircase.

I’m not discouraged, any success is awesome :) but I don’t have too much pride to not ask for advice. Do any of you have any words of wisdom for me? Things to look for next time, different inductions or deepeners? Possible reasons the trigger didn’t work, and ways to address it?

I ask because I subscribe to Barnett’s six principles of Hypnoanalysis. It dates back to the 80s. I applied it in practice, and I enjoy rereading (studying from) the book again now. 

Hunter’s book was published after I certified as a hypnotherapist. As I stated in posts earlier, I stopped practicing as a lay hypnotherapist a few years ago (at more or less the time Hunter’s book was published) and I am refreshing my training now. I was surprised to see how widely Hunter is credited with parts therapy, but, while I have merely watched his demonstrations of parts therapy on YouTube, it seems similar in material ways, while the differences are not really obvious in the YouTube demonstrations.

&lt;p&gt;I ask because I subscribe to Barnett’s six principles of Hypnoanalysis. It dates back to the 80s. I applied it in practice, and I enjoy rereading (studying from) the book again now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter’s book was published after I certified as a hypnotherapist. As I stated in posts earlier, I stopped practicing as a lay hypnotherapist a few years ago (at more or less the time Hunter’s book was published) and I am refreshing my training now. I was surprised to see how widely Hunter is credited with parts therapy, but, while I have merely watched his demonstrations of parts therapy on YouTube, it seems similar in material ways, while the differences are not really obvious in the YouTube demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly: Which approach works best for you?&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"I procrastinate sometimes, choosing to put things off to do later rather than now, when I have time do it now. Why? Because I like doing things WHEN I want and for the REASON that I want - NOT when I am told to do something, and NOT for the reason that I am told to do it. 

But procrastination causes problems for me. Things on my To-Do-List keeps getting longer. And then, BAM! Everything must be done all at the same time. 

When things backfire like that, I put my head down, focus, and do everything, one-by-one, taking the time and making the effort, until everything is done I feel back in control.

It gives me a rush of adrenaline.

I realized I work the hardest, and I enjoy my work the most, when I have a LOT of things to do, with very tight deadlines. I should not get a chance to breathe because then I will procrastinate again. Knowing that, I built a career where this pressure is normal. At work (I am a tax consultant for a big four audit firm and I get big bucks to make other people’s tax problems go away), I enjoy it when month-end comes around and my clients have impossible demands for help with things that they should have done yesterday, and for that to be done NOW. And we charge a lot of money for that. Because it means we have to work hard, and fast, to get everything done within the time frames allowed. 

But at home, I hate doing things if it can be done tomorrow, or next week. And then a month goes by and I didn’t do anything. 

The same happened with my garage, for example. Slowly but surely, the garage got so full of clutter and stuff that I couldn’t fit my car in there anymore. And I would promise myself I would fix it this weekend. And you guessed right; it’s been every week like that, and it’s caused a lot of unnecessary tension at home. Plus, the garage never got sorted out. 

So one day, I shared the story with a friend at work. We were comparing war-stories-at-home.

But this friend put down what he was doing, and looked at me. He asked me: “Do you know where to start?”

I thought he wanted to make a joke, so I waited for the punch line. 

“In the kitchen,” he said. 

I couldn’t understand the joke. He saw the blank look on my face and he explained:

If you have an impossible task ahead, one that’s going to rob you of a lot of time and freedom to do other things that you would rather do, to have fun instead, you start by looking for something similar to do, but something small. In my example, he said I should look for a drawer or a closet or something small that needs sorting and cleaning out. We all have little things that pile up around the house. So, he said, go and select one of those smaller tasks that’s similar to your goal (a kitchen drawer) and tackle that. Put all your effort into that, and get it done. Then a closet. Then a bedroom. 

What’s the point of that? My garage would still be a mess!

“The point is, you teach yourself, that you CAN and you WILL, DO what you MUST, WHEN the time is right. And the time is ALWAYS RIGHT.”

Since then, whenever I feel I have an impossible task ahead, I break it up into smaller tasks, and focus on each task one-by-one, until it is done. 

I don’t allow myself to get distracted by the idea that it’s going to take forever to get through, or that all the tasks add up to a lifetime of doing things I would rather not be doing at this time. Because once you allow yourself to get distracted by that thought, you will never do anything that MUST be done, especially since what you WANT to do instead, is always going to be more fun, but WORTH NOTHING in the end.

,hypnosis,"I've tried many times to use hypnosis as aid to different things over the years but it doesn't do anything other than relax me a little, I know belief can be an amazing tool for change, so I thought I should ask some clarifying questions as to what I may be doing wrong.

1-What does it mean to ""go deeper"" or ""go twice as deep""? Most hypnosis tell you that repeatedly but no one tells you HOW to ""go deeper"". For instance, I know how to relax my body and enter a trance like state but I can't ""relax twice as much"" if I'm already relaxed, this instruction is confusing. I'm pretty sure everyone will interpret this command in a different way when they hear it. Same goes for ""go higher"" or ""enter a higher state of mind"". I have no clue how to do that and I'm left thinking if I did the thing correctly because no change is felt at the time.

2-When I'm already in trance, am I supposed to actively do something when following the instructions or am I supposed to just listen and let another part of my mind work for me? Like if the instruction is ""make sure you solidified these changes in yourself"" How the hell do I do that? I have no idea what this means.

3-Installing trigger phrases, ""every time I say the word X, you will do Y"". Am I supposed to actively execute the command or just believe that it will be executed on it's own?

4-Whenever they tell you ""your eyes are glued shut, test them to make sure"" I will always pretend I'm trying to open my eyes to try to instill the belief in myself that they're actually glued shut but deep down I know that I can open my eyes anytime if I choose to do so, so I feel like I'm faking it when this happens.

,hypnosis,"Hello

Im totally new here so let me know if this isn’t relevant or if it’s been answered and I just haven’t come across it yet!

I (24F) went to a hypnotherapist on Thursday to seek out help for chronic insomnia. I’ve had this about 10 ish years, and also have ptsd. The origin of my ptsd, I believe, impacted my sleep (scared to sleep with the light off, can’t relax, can’t keep eyes closed long enough, fidgety).

It was such a strange and cool experience, I was hopeful this would help! Mind you, I remain open-minded to it and have another appointment... but since then I haven’t slept a wink! Thursday night was the same as always, falling asleep maybe around 5am and waking up at 8 ish. Friday night I stayed up all night, did 48 hours up. And last night I was up til 6 am but then fell asleep and woke up at 10.

I’ve followed the therapists recommendations: sleep routine before bed (same every night), same time, phrase to repeat about how I am able to fall asleep easily, she recommended having a gesture and suggested I keep a hand on my stomach to train my body and mind that when all this happens in sequence, it means sleep is near. 

Am I doing something wrong? 
I’ve had a dull headache since after the appointment, as well. This started before all my nights up. 

Any word of encouragement, suggestions, and/or explanations would be amazing. I’m at the end of my rope with this insomnia and am becoming slightly discouraged, as this seems to be my doctors last solution for me (we cycled through all sleep medications, natural remedies, other meds with side effects of drowsiness, even, I did therapy for my ptsd and medication for that didn’t help either).

My question is can I use the word ‘unless’ in my self-hypnosis statement. For example, “I abstain from alcohol unless it is with those I trust.” 

I know it’s the same as saying “I only consume alcohol with those whom I trust.” 

But this is an example.Would love some opinions from people who practice hypnosis whether there is a difference in the two sentences and if it’s okay to use either.

,hypnosis,"I have already asked my hypnotherapist these questions but I wanted to ask the community as well to see if there are additional prospectives. 

My first session yesterday was around 90 minutes+. The majority being the interview beforehand. I felt the hypnotherapist really had a great understanding of my deep rooted problems with weight management. Her assessment is that my inner child is rebelling against adult decisions I need to make about my health and wellness. 

So while going under on our journey I kept daydreaming about the most random things. I guess I had to be “under” because it was almost as if her voice was in the background of my daydream and I had to really focus on coming back to her voice. I don’t think I was sleeping. At the end of the session she said I’d remember it all and while I do sort of remember the gist of the session, there are sections missing. Almost like I wasn’t paying attention in class and cannot remember the details. What’s going on here? Could this be due to my inexperience with hypnosis? Was the session less effective because I couldn’t keep tuned in?

Also wondering what would be an average number of sessions that you have found help with weight management? 

I decided to book a follow up session in a few weeks. It has been mentioned to me before that the best prep for hypnosis is hypnosis.

so we all know about hypnosis and how it can really influence our subconscious mind, right?

I've been hearing about erotic hypnosis and how some people (especially men) try to mind control other people to get them to be their s3x slaves. I know that sounds scary and it actually is.

One tactic that he uses is hypnosis. He has them conditioned so that when he says a certain word, they will stop what they are doing and immediately do what he says. 

In one scene, Monica is about to leave. He says the word, and then she drops her bags. He tells her to spin around and then get on all fours and bark like a dog, which she does. Then they have make-up sex. In her POV, she blames the argument on herself and stays with him.

The two women escape and live together, but the abuser contacts Monica and leaves a recording of his voice. She listens to it and she hears the ""magic"" and is then hypnotized. She sends an email asking him what he wants. He asks her to meet him, which she 100% would not do in her normal mental state. She does, and he wants to watch her kill the other girl. He gives her a gun, and both enter the apartment and find the other girl. The abuser orders Monica to kill Jane, but Monica can't do it and refuses. Does this seem possible?

,hypnosis,"backstory:
I’ve been exploring self-hypnosis for about 7 years (net. 2-3 years if you want to count action), and I’ve gotten to greater heights than I ever have before. I’ve been able to go what may feel like the floating down phenomenon ( some like to say multi-dimensional but I’m not sure about that) and for the past few months I haven’t been able to get to the floating down phenomenon anymore. Besides that, I have gotten better at getting myself to a trans much quicker.

problem:
I have a habit and forming routine of self-hypnotizing before going to sleep and I feel like I have:
Nightmares/really intense dreams when I sleep in trans,
Longer sleep and being able to return to my dream after waking for a short moment,
And there was this one day where I woke up with a weird psychosis that I thought there were spiders on my back and seized myself out of bed and into the hallway. I scared my sister she thought I was actually having a seizure but it was really me getting out of my tight burrito of a blanket.

So yea, are these symptoms justified? Is there something I should know about hypnosis that may be causing this?

And one more thing; I’m self taught. At the beginning of my journey I copied the stage hypnosis techniques, then after revisiting I used some techniques from Youtube and Self-Hypnosis audios.  I’d love to know more of the science behind all this. Really interesting. (Off topic Question: I’ve never been able to stay hypnotized while standing up.

I've had severe depression (bipolar type II) and anxiety for 20+ years now.  Despite this, I've always had certain things I believed - people are generally good, I want to help people, we're all connected; that kind of thing.  Since the pandemic, my depression has become so severe that it has lapsed into the realm of debilitating.  All the garbage in the sociopolitical sphere that came with the virus has left me with an intense and nihilistic view of humanity.  There were a few days in there where I was sincerely rooting for the virus to win.  It got dark.  

Despite things somewhat improving and my getting vaccinated, my faith in humanity has been so severely shaken that I'm even considering leaving the medical field.  

In a couple of weeks I'll be undergoing ketamine therapy for my depression.  The process takes about an hour, and from what I've read you're extremely susceptible to hypnosis during the infusions.  I was hoping someone could point me to some good audio hypnosis that could do the following:

,hypnosis,"I am inquiring about the use of affirmations and which form a person might respond best to, as in:

I am getting better.
vs
You are getting better.

I know there is debate about which form to use,  when it's pretty obvious it depends on the person.  One form being the right form to use for an individual, not for everyone.

What I am wondering, is if there is a way to test for which form a person will best respond to linguistically, or conversationally, the way one can test for suggestibility, or similar to determining if a person is better served by direct suggestion or a more permissive form. 

My reasoning is that while I know many peoples self talk might follow a pattern of:

'I have to stop this or I am going to get fired.'

   I personally am more likely to self talk in the form:

'You better stop that, or you are going to get fired'.

I suspected  this would be a direct indicator of which form I would be more likely to respond to, but I am no longer certain this is always true.

I recently heard the logic that we modify our behavior  first from being told... 'You need to do X' , and upon hearing or thinking it repeatedly, eventually we phrase it as 'I need to do X' when we begin to make it true for ourselves.

So it's still not 100% clear to me if this is or isn't a concrete indicator.

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s still not 100% clear to me if this is or isn&amp;#39;t a concrete indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have suspected at some times that it&amp;#39;s overly analytical people who need it phrased one way, and the rest of people the other.. but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am just hoping this has been analysed before and that there is an answer here..&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"Howdy,   


I've struggled with a pornography addiction for years. (Since at least age 11!) And while I have tried many methods over the years, I have not really found a viable solution? I know in my years of watching I have seen a few hypnosis videos that had effects on me that I don't want. While I'm straight as can be, I don't want the triggers the sex hypnosis gave like crossdressing and the like. It's not my cup of tea.   


While I am aware there are many things I would need to do, I feel like hypnosis is a good avenue to follow because of how effective it can be on top of other methods. I feel like removing triggers would help and even heal my subconscious by allowing it to block certain thoughts. I feel like it would give me a confidence boost if I do it enough.   


I would assume the steps to healing would be:   
1. Remove the triggers  
2. Replace with positive things like ""working out"" etc.   
3. Repeat multiple times (At least 3X) a week over a 6 week period.

,hypnosis,"Day 3! That's better continuity than any valve title I'll have you know. I apologize for the delay, something important kinda came up and I didn't really have time for these reports. But I'm back now and ready to continue!

If you don't know what this is refer to my original post [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/mfbdgx/my_troubles_with_trance_and_how_i_aim_to_overcome/)

Previous Day: [Day #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/mi729a/pushing_through_tbti_day_2/) 

First Day: [Day #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/mhao9q/tbti_day_1_staring_at_yourself_is_kinda_terrifying/)

&amp;#x200B;

Current techniques I'm practicing are: The mirror technique, the light switch technique, and some visualization training.

 I'm going to be honest with you, on top of the delay, this day hasn't been very eventful, mostly because of my lack of diligence. However hopefully in the next few updates I'll get more consistent.

I didn't do any visualization training today, so I won't comment on that. I'd still like to do more research on visualization training methods as well but that's besides the point. I've done the lightswitch technique a few times today, I'd say around 6, which while not perfect is still an improvement from my previous record of 4. I've got to say for an avid procrastinator such as myself interspersing little nuggets of productivity throughout your day is much more difficult than I'd imagined, as opposed to having one big activity that you do once in a day. But I'll definitely find a way that works for me, but I'll make it so every time I sit down on my computer I'll take a 1 minute or so to do one light switch session.

The sessions themselves were more of the same, light numb feeling if I relax hard and or long enough, and no ground breaking revelations just yet. This is still day 3 after all, and a very delayed day 3 I might add.

For this attempt at the mirror technique I tried to incorporate the aspect of 'minimal lightning' more, by having my phone's flashlight flashing at the wall besides my which reflected onto me at a lower luminosity. My previous sessions simply had the light from the hallway outside my room bleeding in and as I have a sort of breathing window at the top of my room (don't ask) a fair amount of light bleeds in. And to be honest, I think I prefer my old method. Retrospectively I think that 'minimal lighting' just means enough light that you can technically still see your face but not enough that it's clear as day. And while my old method certainly wasn't very 'bright' (both figuratively and metaphorically), I could still see the features of my face and the dimness of the room allowed for my mind to fill in the blanks which is a gateway to the wacky demorphing I've experienced before. This time around, assisted by my reflected phone-flashlight, I did still see some hallucination, a surprising amount focused on my mouth of all things, becoming smaller and thinner etc.  At some point my face would keep morphing to what my face would look like it was taken to photoshop and was content aware scaled to look like I was frowning, it was quite comical to see. At other points what I can only describe as a small anus would appear between my eyebrows which I took as my subcouncious trying to tell my I'm shit-brained. 

  User [u/4quatioos](https://www.reddit.com/u/4quatioos/), a reoccurring guest in these progress reports, suggested that I focus on my breathing for a multitude of reasons ranging from increasing my focusing skills to allowing my brain to get used to the 'lapse' it feels when my focus shifts and I start daydreaming. Needless to say I experienced many 'lapses' during this experience, clearly my focusing skills could use some work. However this session specifically wasn't very good as I get distracting myself with outside things instead of keeping my full attention on the reflection. So we'll see more definitive results in future reports.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

But I&amp;#39;m back now and ready to continue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous Day: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/mi729a/pushing_through_tbti_day_2/""&gt;Day #2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Day: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/mhao9q/tbti_day_1_staring_at_yourself_is_kinda_terrifying/""&gt;Day #1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current techniques I&amp;#39;m practicing are: The mirror technique, the light switch technique, and some visualization training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to be honest with you, on top of the delay, this day hasn&amp;#39;t been very eventful, mostly because of my lack of diligence. However hopefully in the next few updates I&amp;#39;ll get more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t do any visualization training today, so I won&amp;#39;t comment on that. I&amp;#39;d still like to do more research on visualization training methods as well but that&amp;#39;s besides the point. I&amp;#39;ve done the lightswitch technique a few times today, I&amp;#39;d say around 6, which while not perfect is still an improvement from my previous record of 4. I&amp;#39;ve got to say for an avid procrastinator such as myself interspersing little nuggets of productivity throughout your day is much more difficult than I&amp;#39;d imagined, as opposed to having one big activity that you do once in a day. But I&amp;#39;ll definitely find a way that works for me, but I&amp;#39;ll make it so every time I sit down on my computer I&amp;#39;ll take a 1 minute or so to do one light switch session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sessions themselves were more of the same, light numb feeling if I relax hard and or long enough, and no ground breaking revelations just yet. This is still day 3 after all, and a very delayed day 3 I might add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this attempt at the mirror technique I tried to incorporate the aspect of &amp;#39;minimal lightning&amp;#39; more, by having my phone&amp;#39;s flashlight flashing at the wall besides my which reflected onto me at a lower luminosity. My previous sessions simply had the light from the hallway outside my room bleeding in and as I have a sort of breathing window at the top of my room (don&amp;#39;t ask) a fair amount of light bleeds in. And to be honest, I think I prefer my old method. Retrospectively I think that &amp;#39;minimal lighting&amp;#39; just means enough light that you can technically still see your face but not enough that it&amp;#39;s clear as day. And while my old method certainly wasn&amp;#39;t very &amp;#39;bright&amp;#39; (both figuratively and metaphorically), I could still see the features of my face and the dimness of the room allowed for my mind to fill in the blanks which is a gateway to the wacky demorphing I&amp;#39;ve experienced before. This time around, assisted by my reflected phone-flashlight, I did still see some hallucination, a surprising amount focused on my mouth of all things, becoming smaller and thinner etc.  At some point my face would keep morphing to what my face would look like it was taken to photoshop and was content aware scaled to look like I was frowning, it was quite comical to see. At other points what I can only describe as a small anus would appear between my eyebrows which I took as my subcouncious trying to tell my I&amp;#39;m shit-brained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/4quatioos/""&gt;u/4quatioos&lt;/a&gt;, a reoccurring guest in these progress reports, suggested that I focus on my breathing for a multitude of reasons ranging from increasing my focusing skills to allowing my brain to get used to the &amp;#39;lapse&amp;#39; it feels when my focus shifts and I start daydreaming. Needless to say I experienced many &amp;#39;lapses&amp;#39; during this experience, clearly my focusing skills could use some work. However this session specifically wasn&amp;#39;t very good as I get distracting myself with outside things instead of keeping my full attention on the reflection. So we&amp;#39;ll see more definitive results in future reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, thank you for reading this or keeping up with me if you have. I apologize again for the delay but I look forward to what the future holds! If you have any suggestions for activities I should practice to improve my ability to trance make sure to mention them and help me out!

,hypnosis,"For me, hypnotherapy is exclusively about treating the spirit. (And for me, the spirit is what is left when you step outside of your waking circumstance and waking situation.)

When the spirit is healed, this often has the happy consequence of creating positive physical or mental outcomes. Those outcomes are a by-product, or a 'side-effect' of the healed spirit.

,hypnosis,"Hi, I just wanted to share a few of my experiences/observations with self hypnosis.

First of all I’ve always looked into hypnosis aids because I use to be a hard trancer. While I’ve tried a lot of them, I’ve noticed a little bit of glycine seems to help the best, I go really deep into trance with it and get natural amnesia. So might be worth trying as a hypnotic aid for some people. Note I suffer from hypomania often, so maybe it just helps my mind calm down.

Secondly I’ve noticed after a self hypnosis session, I can be triggered into hypomania, this has happened several times.

Thirdly, and most interesting, is my observations of hypomania and subconscious programming, is they are very much linked. Hypomania is like a go type behaviour, it’s automatic, and your ability to inhibit your behaviours are diminished. When I was addicted to weed and alcohol, I would automatically seek them out when hypomanic regardless of risk, thankfully I was able to stop these with self hypnosis. However suggestions like enjoying exercise, when I became hypomanic I would exercise for ages, or suggestions for being more productive, I ended up doing a load of diy work around the house for days or rearrange my garden by moving huge boulders. I even gave myself suggestions to enjoy video games again, as a way to have something to do instead of substance abuse, and then I ended up spending all my time playing games when I became hypomanic. It’s still not a great thing though, because you’re on Go/automatic mode, and you don’t think things through. But I’ve definitely noticed whatever suggestions I feed myself via self hypnosis, they are amplified a lot when I become hypomanic. I guess this is why some people with bipolar can become very successful, because if they have that subconscious programming for certain types of work, they can become very productive in it. But the double edged sword is if you have bad subconscious programming, you do a lot more risky behaviours you can’t control.

Fourthly while not discussed here much, I’ve had great success with instant self hypnosis (eyes open reading out load self hypnosis). I think it’s a good alternative to audio self hypnosis, especially when you suffer from things like lack of concentration (reading helps keep focus), sleep apnea (choking when going into trance), or fall asleep in trance because you’re tired.

Lastly I’ve noticed I will get blurry vision after coming out of a instant self hypnosis session for about 15 minutes. I think this is a type of lingering disassociation or something.",t2_hi9wc,False,,0,False,"Bipolar/hypomania, glycine (hypnotic aid), and self hypnosis observations",[],r/hypnosis,False,6,,0,,False,t3_mixene,False,dark,0.79,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1617438102.0,text,6,,,text,self.hypnosis,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I just wanted to share a few of my experiences/observations with self hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all I’ve always looked into hypnosis aids because I use to be a hard trancer. While I’ve tried a lot of them, I’ve noticed a little bit of glycine seems to help the best, I go really deep into trance with it and get natural amnesia. So might be worth trying as a hypnotic aid for some people. Note I suffer from hypomania often, so maybe it just helps my mind calm down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly I’ve noticed after a self hypnosis session, I can be triggered into hypomania, this has happened several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, and most interesting, is my observations of hypomania and subconscious programming, is they are very much linked. Hypomania is like a go type behaviour, it’s automatic, and your ability to inhibit your behaviours are diminished. When I was addicted to weed and alcohol, I would automatically seek them out when hypomanic regardless of risk, thankfully I was able to stop these with self hypnosis. However suggestions like enjoying exercise, when I became hypomanic I would exercise for ages, or suggestions for being more productive, I ended up doing a load of diy work around the house for days or rearrange my garden by moving huge boulders. I even gave myself suggestions to enjoy video games again, as a way to have something to do instead of substance abuse, and then I ended up spending all my time playing games when I became hypomanic. It’s still not a great thing though, because you’re on Go/automatic mode, and you don’t think things through. But I’ve definitely noticed whatever suggestions I feed myself via self hypnosis, they are amplified a lot when I become hypomanic. I guess this is why some people with bipolar can become very successful, because if they have that subconscious programming for certain types of work, they can become very productive in it. But the double edged sword is if you have bad subconscious programming, you do a lot more risky behaviours you can’t control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly while not discussed here much, I’ve had great success with instant self hypnosis (eyes open reading out load self hypnosis). I think it’s a good alternative to audio self hypnosis, especially when you suffer from things like lack of concentration (reading helps keep focus), sleep apnea (choking when going into trance), or fall asleep in trance because you’re tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I’ve noticed I will get blurry vision after coming out of a instant self hypnosis session for about 15 minutes. I think this is a type of lingering disassociation or something.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the main gist is that my brain doesn't like going into trance when I want it to, so I gotta give it a good spanking until it learns to be a good little collection of neurons and shut off it's left side for a bit. Basically, training my brain to become more responsive to hypnotic suggestion.

I'm hoping that as I continue to do this I'll get more suggestions of activities to add to the routine, but for now we're stuck with three. Those being the mirror technique as suggested by [u/4quatioos](https://www.reddit.com/u/4quatioos/), the light switch technique, and some visualization training. Let's go through my progress in day 2.

Click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/mhao9q/tbti_day_1_staring_at_yourself_is_kinda_terrifying/) for day 1, where I reveal how much of a coward I am.

&amp;#x200B;

The visualization training was something I thought of doing when writing my last report, as a response to my difficulty visualizing during the light switch technique. When I sat down to do this, I closed my eyes and imagined an apple, red in color, leafless stem and with slight water drops dripping across it's surface. I tried to imagine the exact texture of the apple's surface, and  to picture it rotating to show every side. Eventually I pictured a background too, that being my kitchen, where the apple sat on a ceramic plate atop a round glass table. I kept imaging this in many different angles. Eventually I made the apple have a bite taken out out of it, and tried to picture that from different angles. In the end, it felt like I had a full 3D model of the apple and plate I could rotate and view as I please. However, the image still wasn't very clear, and I had to exert a lot of focus to keep the image in my head. All in all, not too dazzling results this time but I'm optimistic for the future. I might even research more about visualization training to see if there are even better methods I should be taking advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the light switch technique, I didn't get in as many sessions I would've liked. In the few that I did I simply felt my body relaxing after a while and nothing more, I guess with this technique it really only becomes interesting in the end game. One thing I will point out though, is I have trouble deciding what I should be thinking of while switched off, if I even should be worrying about my thoughts. Would keeping the image of the switched off light switch be best? To reinforce the connection in my brain? Or does it have no impact, and I can think of whatever I want? Also how long should each session be? These are all good questions which I should probably go back and reference the original post for.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally the mirror technique, the most interesting one at this current stage. Last time I chickened out of doing the full 10 minutes. However, I have kept my promise and have completed the full 10 minutes this time around. I *maaaay* have taken a small break 4 minutes in but let's not bother with semantics. During my time staring at the deep dark voids that are my eyes I experienced more of what I experienced last time with slightly more clarity and more consistency (since I actually did it for 10 minutes this time). I noticed that after a few minutes, my vision would frequently black out for a bit and slowly come back, with my face recovering from the blackness even slower. To illustrate, my vision would would darken for a bit, with the darkness being mostly focused at the center of my vision, then luminance would slowly return to my surroundings and return even slower for my face. This lead to moments where I would be staring at an image of my face with one half darkened like I was some super villain. This ""vision darkening and slowly returning back"" thing is something that I sometimes experience normally when lying down for an extended period of time than suddenly standing back up, I don't know if that's related but hey take that as you will.

Usually the first illusion/hallucination I would encounter doing this is my eyes becoming unfocused dark blobs. It honestly just feels like a symptom of eye fatigue so I'm unsure exactly what to think of it. When I get deeper into the experience there's more face demorphing. I noticed that my hair would change too, either shortening or changing style all together. Nothing sophisticated, it wasn't like I was scrolling through a hair selection screen in a video game, but every so often it would be slightly more off than it actually is, with the severity of difference varying.

My face itself would change as well, when my eyes aren't dark blobs, it feels like they aren't where they should be, I can't find a way to describe it other than a lack of synchronization, or something akin to a lazy eye. The edge of my mouth at one point would keep pointing down, apparently mirror me didn't really like being stared at. My facial structure changed a bit sometimes, becoming longer and almost more defined? I find that a common theme with facial changes is that my cheeks are sort of sucked in. Other than that at one point I thought I saw a small flash of light behind me but I'm not too sure about it.

One thing I will say about this mirror technique is that it's surprising just how anxious it makes me feel. I would be sitting in my room, getting ready to start doing it, feeling confident, wondering why I had any trouble with it before. Only to start panicking when I actually start doing it. I become very aware of my heart rate and every part of my body is begging me to move away from the mirror. As I was writing this I read  [u/4quatioos](https://www.reddit.com/u/4quatioos/) 's suggestion to focus on deep breathes which might help in the anxiousness department. I tried suggesting to myself that I was calm and relaxed which, if nothing else, at least motivated me to keep going. Either way, I feel both excitement and dread at attempting this technique for the next 12 days.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

* I learnt how to export 3D models in my brain
* I need to reread the light switch post
* Staring at myself is still terrifying but doable.

TLDR is: I have trouble trancing, and want to try training my brain to become better at it for 2 weeks, documenting my progress each day.

Currently there are mainly two things I'm practicing each day, those being the light switch technique and the mirror technique. I call them techniques because I don't know if these methods actually have names. I'm hoping that as I go along more people will suggest different things that I can add to the routine. At the pace I'm going at, I likely won't hit my goal of experiencing an automatic response to a suggestion, however the experience is still worth it and these 2 weeks will likely put me in a better position than if I had done nothing at all. Anyways, enough exposition, let's get down to the actual progress.

Since I currently only have 2 activities that I'm actively trying to do, those are the ones I'll be talking about.

The first of which being the light switch technique. One thing about this technique is that I have to keep reminding myself to do it. I'm aiming to be practicing at least 10 times per day, and since my current pace is closer to 2 per day, we're gonna need some more work. One thing I didn't imagine would be an issue is visualizing the light switch itself. I didn't touch upon this in my original post, but my visualization ability isn't great. In fact, when I learnt what Aphantasia was, I had to seriously sit down and ponder whether I had the condition or not. I came to the conclusion that I am able to visualize mental images, just poorly, and I require a lot of focus to keep that image present. This presents itself very much during the light switch technique. I need to exert a lot of focus simply to keep the image of the light switch in my head, then I  jump to an image of it switched off and go numb. Writing this now, I think that I remember the OP of the light switch post mentioned also visualizing a hand pressing on switch, so there's that I guess. When I first discovered and attempted the technique, I had an issue keeping the light switch in the position I wanted it in without my mind jumping to the other position. I've had to visualize text above and below the switch, reading On and Off respectively, which did kind of help with this issue. Seeing as I'm struggling with visualization. I think adding some sort of visualization training to my routine might be the way to go. I've read somewhere about training your visualization by imagining something and continuing to ask yourself for more detail until it becomes clearer, I haven't attempted this yet but the idea does seem interesting and I'll get back to you on it in the second progress update.

&amp;#x200B;

The second, and focal point of this progress update is the mirror technique. Now if you haven't read my original post, u/4quatloos suggested that I try to stare at myself in a mirror for 10 minutes. He claimed this may induce hallucination or day dreaming, and that it's a good standard to check if I lack discipline or patience, a fair point. So I tried it, and let's just say, I failed miserably. One thing you need to know about me, is that I'm what the scientific community would describe as a 'little bitch'. I was that kid who couldn't go to the bathroom by himself at night for an embarrassingly long time. I never liked or watched horror movies, and I'm only recently starting to warm up to some horror games. One time as a kid, I clicked on a link that lead to a Jeff the killer screamer, I couldn't open my phone for a full day until my dad opened it for me to close the link. Like I said, a little bitch. Now let me tell you, staring at myself was way more terrifying than I'd thought it would be, you're telling me that I have to stare at a mirror for an extended period, a mirror, the most common horror trope for bad shit to happen. And on top of that you're saying I might hallucinate?! Suffice to say, for the first day I could only stare at myself for about 4 minutes in short intervals. I tried again the next day and managed to do 5 minutes in a single session which is technically progress? Yes this is all very silly, I assure you by next progress report I'll get my shit together and force myself to do a full 10 minutes. Being afraid of my own mind should not be an issue for someone trying to explore their mind. But in my short time with this technique I did notice some interesting things. First of all I always had the urge to move around, standing still wouldn't cut it for me. Even if my head and torso were straight, my feet would be continuously fidgeting. I guess I kept trying to convince myself that the reflection was, in fact, me and was mimicking my movements. Which is a terrible thing to do when I'm trying to trick my brain into thinking it's being stared at intensely. So again, I'll work on it. One thing I experienced is that my face became sort of deformed at one point? My eyes became slightly narrower, my mouth widened a bit, and my facial structure became more gaunt. My instinct wants me to say ""it was all just in my head"" but I guess that's sort of the point. See, any 'hallucinations' I saw were mostly related to my face, mostly my eyes. With them either glowing a bit, or changing shape slightly before coming back. I hesitate to call these 'hallucinations', as they felt more like visual illusions to me. I'm not really sure what qualifies as a hallucination anyways so I guess I'll keep going either way. Also I found it surprisingly hard to get lost in my own thoughts, which would've made the wait easier. I'm usually very good at exploring my thoughts but when staring at myself it felt like my full focus *had* to be on the reflection. My guess is this will become easier with time. Then again, if the aim of this exercise is to trigger a fight or flight response as u/4quatioos suggested, then maybe my brain doesn't see day-dreaming as the most optimal course of action in a potentially dangerous situation, just speculation though.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

* Will try do more light switch sessions.
* Will aim for 10 minutes of creepy self admiration.
* Might add visualization exercises to my routine.

See you tomorrow I guess!

I know I&amp;#39;m sort of late on this but better late than never right? If you don&amp;#39;t know what this is, check out my previous post: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/mfbdgx/my_troubles_with_trance_and_how_i_aim_to_overcome/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR is: I have trouble trancing, and want to try training my brain to become better at it for 2 weeks, documenting my progress each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there are mainly two things I&amp;#39;m practicing each day, those being the light switch technique and the mirror technique. I call them techniques because I don&amp;#39;t know if these methods actually have names. I&amp;#39;m hoping that as I go along more people will suggest different things that I can add to the routine. At the pace I&amp;#39;m going at, I likely won&amp;#39;t hit my goal of experiencing an automatic response to a suggestion, however the experience is still worth it and these 2 weeks will likely put me in a better position than if I had done nothing at all. Anyways, enough exposition, let&amp;#39;s get down to the actual progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I currently only have 2 activities that I&amp;#39;m actively trying to do, those are the ones I&amp;#39;ll be talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of which being the light switch technique. One thing about this technique is that I have to keep reminding myself to do it. I&amp;#39;m aiming to be practicing at least 10 times per day, and since my current pace is closer to 2 per day, we&amp;#39;re gonna need some more work. One thing I didn&amp;#39;t imagine would be an issue is visualizing the light switch itself. I didn&amp;#39;t touch upon this in my original post, but my visualization ability isn&amp;#39;t great. In fact, when I learnt what Aphantasia was, I had to seriously sit down and ponder whether I had the condition or not. I came to the conclusion that I am able to visualize mental images, just poorly, and I require a lot of focus to keep that image present. This presents itself very much during the light switch technique. I need to exert a lot of focus simply to keep the image of the light switch in my head, then I  jump to an image of it switched off and go numb. Writing this now, I think that I remember the OP of the light switch post mentioned also visualizing a hand pressing on switch, so there&amp;#39;s that I guess. When I first discovered and attempted the technique, I had an issue keeping the light switch in the position I wanted it in without my mind jumping to the other position. I&amp;#39;ve had to visualize text above and below the switch, reading On and Off respectively, which did kind of help with this issue. Seeing as I&amp;#39;m struggling with visualization. I think adding some sort of visualization training to my routine might be the way to go. I&amp;#39;ve read somewhere about training your visualization by imagining something and continuing to ask yourself for more detail until it becomes clearer, I haven&amp;#39;t attempted this yet but the idea does seem interesting and I&amp;#39;ll get back to you on it in the second progress update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, and focal point of this progress update is the mirror technique. Now if you haven&amp;#39;t read my original post, &lt;a href=""/u/4quatloos""&gt;u/4quatloos&lt;/a&gt; suggested that I try to stare at myself in a mirror for 10 minutes. He claimed this may induce hallucination or day dreaming, and that it&amp;#39;s a good standard to check if I lack discipline or patience, a fair point. So I tried it, and let&amp;#39;s just say, I failed miserably. One thing you need to know about me, is that I&amp;#39;m what the scientific community would describe as a &amp;#39;little bitch&amp;#39;. I was that kid who couldn&amp;#39;t go to the bathroom by himself at night for an embarrassingly long time. I never liked or watched horror movies, and I&amp;#39;m only recently starting to warm up to some horror games. One time as a kid, I clicked on a link that lead to a Jeff the killer screamer, I couldn&amp;#39;t open my phone for a full day until my dad opened it for me to close the link. Like I said, a little bitch. Now let me tell you, staring at myself was way more terrifying than I&amp;#39;d thought it would be, you&amp;#39;re telling me that I have to stare at a mirror for an extended period, a mirror, the most common horror trope for bad shit to happen. And on top of that you&amp;#39;re saying I might hallucinate?! Suffice to say, for the first day I could only stare at myself for about 4 minutes in short intervals. I tried again the next day and managed to do 5 minutes in a single session which is technically progress? Yes this is all very silly, I assure you by next progress report I&amp;#39;ll get my shit together and force myself to do a full 10 minutes. Being afraid of my own mind should not be an issue for someone trying to explore their mind. But in my short time with this technique I did notice some interesting things. First of all I always had the urge to move around, standing still wouldn&amp;#39;t cut it for me. Even if my head and torso were straight, my feet would be continuously fidgeting. I guess I kept trying to convince myself that the reflection was, in fact, me and was mimicking my movements. Which is a terrible thing to do when I&amp;#39;m trying to trick my brain into thinking it&amp;#39;s being stared at intensely. So again, I&amp;#39;ll work on it. One thing I experienced is that my face became sort of deformed at one point? My eyes became slightly narrower, my mouth widened a bit, and my facial structure became more gaunt. My instinct wants me to say &amp;quot;it was all just in my head&amp;quot; but I guess that&amp;#39;s sort of the point. See, any &amp;#39;hallucinations&amp;#39; I saw were mostly related to my face, mostly my eyes. With them either glowing a bit, or changing shape slightly before coming back. I hesitate to call these &amp;#39;hallucinations&amp;#39;, as they felt more like visual illusions to me. I&amp;#39;m not really sure what qualifies as a hallucination anyways so I guess I&amp;#39;ll keep going either way. Also I found it surprisingly hard to get lost in my own thoughts, which would&amp;#39;ve made the wait easier. I&amp;#39;m usually very good at exploring my thoughts but when staring at myself it felt like my full focus &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be on the reflection. My guess is this will become easier with time. Then again, if the aim of this exercise is to trigger a fight or flight response as &lt;a href=""/u/4quatioos""&gt;u/4quatioos&lt;/a&gt; suggested, then maybe my brain doesn&amp;#39;t see day-dreaming as the most optimal course of action in a potentially dangerous situation, just speculation though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will try do more light switch sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will aim for 10 minutes of creepy self admiration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might add visualization exercises to my routine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you tomorrow I guess!&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"Part of me is debating whether to use a throwaway account for this, since it's kind of personal, but screw it. I also got a chuckle out of the title bar that says ""Submit to hypnosis"" but that's neither here nor there. Anyway.

A little bit of background context, without trying to go into too many details. But I'm notoriously poor at that, and re-reading this bit after typing the below I definitely failed, so if you can't be arsed with the **tl;dr**, skip a few paragraphs. 

It's partly a personal account, and partly a request for comments, advice and suggestions (hypnotic or not!)

I've been interested in - or I should say fascinated by - the concept of hypnosis for many years, but have only recently started learning and researching about it in any kind of depth. At least for more benign and therapeutic applications; of course I'm familiar with many of its darker aspects and the potential for abuse, which is one of the reasons that until very recently even the prospect was enough to send me into extreme bouts of anxiety, even as I found it so interesting that it was difficult to stop reading.

According to most surface-level conventional wisdom, I ""should"" share traits of many highly suggestible subjects. As a child I had an incredibly powerful imagination, was constantly engaging in roleplay and pretend games, had regular spontaneous lucid dreams (one series of which I can still remember and plan to turn into a series of short stories if I can ever find the motivation), and so on. Recently, I don't remember my dreams so much, but I did have one period a few years ago where I really thought to myself that I wanted to and would, and, hey, I actually did.

Even these days, I'm very prone to losing a sense of my surroundings when talking to friends, I seem to be suggestible in general (except with salespeople of whom I am highly critical - a conscious choice), I dislike watching soaps and trashy TV programs because I get emotionally agitated, I often get lost in my own thoughts, moved by fiction, etc. At the same time, I'm also quite an analytical person - I consider myself open-minded but don't believe in wilful ignorance, and while I'm not critical of entertainment media the way some are, I usually don't take things at face value and insist on researching any subject of interest fairly thoroughly to educate myself.

I always held the sanctuary of the mind as sacrosanct, and while I understand just how pliable and manipulable peoples' perceptions are, despite this I feel strongly that nobody should have greater influence over us than we have over ourselves, even if we don't know ourselves as well as we think we do. So when I see hypnotically induced phenomena such as amnesia, triggered/compulsive thoughts and behaviour and the like, it tends to put me on edge and make me feel very anxious. I've never even been drunk to the point I can't remember anything because I don't want to feel like I'm not ""myself"" (and I know that I probably either wouldn't realise or care as much at the time, too...)

At the same time, when I consider the potential benefits if used carefully and wisely - whether for athletic performance, self-confidence, quitting vices, processing trauma and general self-improvement - it's genuinely inspiring. I suppose I've made my peace with it as a tool much like any other. It depends entirely on the intentions of the people that use it.

I'm still very guarded about the prospect of hetero-hypnosis; even though part of me at the back of my mind is kind of curious to experience that type of 'letting go' under someone else's guidance, but I don't trust very easily. (And when I do trust, it can be very all-or-nothing!) However I do trust myself implicitly, so I've recently been experimenting with autosuggestion and self-hypnosis techniques, with mixed results.

I've been very procrastinatory towards work recently, and it often feels like an effort to keep myself on track - I get easily distracted, but at the same time I find it easy to focus on things I'm more interested in. I've flirted with the thought of exercising in the past, but could never maintain any forward momentum after a few weeks when the novelty value wore off. Same thing with self-discipline and schedules - it all ends up feeling like too much effort, so I often just drift back to whatever comes naturally. I tend to be quite permissive in my internal dialogue, which I've noticed seems to translate to passive outward behaviour.

At some points last week I figured enough was enough, and I wanted to see what would happen, so after reading various points about self-hypnosis techniques (in addition to conscious autosuggestion à la Coué), resolved to give it a shot. My initial experiences were... interesting. I've been able to relax (or I should say 'concentrate on relaxing') to the point of what I have now discovered is called catalepsy for years, I think, so that wasn't a problem. Using mental imagery, I was able to suggest to myself to relax my mind a little and let go of a lot of surface tension. Of course, random thoughts and images continuously occur, and I'm always consciously aware, I just try to focus my attention.

But I had what felt like a revelation at one point, where I realised that my perception and memory of the way I was when I was younger was holding me back from embracing the potential for growth and positive change in the present, and my fear of change was a byproduct of my experiences of others changing but that didn't mean I had to hold myself back, trying to recreate an ideal, instead of realising that the future wasn't as set in stone as I believed it was, and whatever I imagined myself to be I could make happen. Suggestions seemed to come to me intuitively, without really thinking - I want to be more confident, to be more socially skilled, to be more organised and proactive in the way that I approach things. I let myself imagine it and believe it was true. It was quite emotional, honestly.

For the next few days, there really was a massive difference - whether because I was consciously following the suggestion or because my subconscious was somehow impacted, I can't say. Perhaps both? I'm honestly happy with not knowing, because the only way for me to know would, paradoxically, be for me to have amnesia which I definitely don't want. I had a lot more motivation, I got more work done in the week than I probably did in the previous two put together, I started exercising more often, and people who know me said they noticed a positive improvement in my demeanour. It felt like instead of being trapped in a routine, everything was fresh and new, despite the only changes being internal.

After a few days, I started to slip back into more common thought/feeling patterns, which I'd say I'm in now, for the most part. But I'm still tidier, I'm still exercising more and I'm still more generally personable. I think. Procrastination is a 50/50, I did lose some momentum there. I'm not sure if I've experienced a trance state yet - I would say if I have then it was probably very mild, but I might have come the closest to it last night before I went to sleep, at which point I felt a floating sensation all over my body, and while I was still consciously aware, my thoughts seemed to have a lot less 'resistance' to them. So I took the opportunity to imagine myself getting up today and feeling great, and having a productive day and, for the most part, it certainly came true (I'm sure the improved weather helps).

I'm currently reading my way through ""The Science of Self-Hypnosis"" by Adam Eason and it certainly makes for interesting reading material (I hate that damn lemon suggestion though! I was only reading it and... well, my salivatory response seems to have a mind of its own. Even typing this wasn't the best idea.) 

**tl;dr** I don't so much want to learn how to put others into hypnosis, just improve my own proficiency in the area. Do any others have experiences and recommendations? I've seen Mike Mandel mentioned, as well as Igor Ledochowski. Is it just a matter of practice, and - well, belief? Ultimately I suppose it doesn't matter if it's purely placebo as long as it's making a positive impact, but even that is intrinsically related, I guess...?",t2_1nuy79jl,False,,0,False,"Self-hypnosis: experiences, thoughts, suggestions, advice?",[],r/hypnosis,False,6,,0,,False,t3_mfvjgf,False,dark,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1617069937.0,text,6,,,text,self.hypnosis,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of me is debating whether to use a throwaway account for this, since it&amp;#39;s kind of personal, but screw it.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been very procrastinatory towards work recently, and it often feels like an effort to keep myself on track - I get easily distracted, but at the same time I find it easy to focus on things I&amp;#39;m more interested in. I&amp;#39;ve flirted with the thought of exercising in the past, but could never maintain any forward momentum after a few weeks when the novelty value wore off. Same thing with self-discipline and schedules - it all ends up feeling like too much effort, so I often just drift back to whatever comes naturally. I tend to be quite permissive in my internal dialogue, which I&amp;#39;ve noticed seems to translate to passive outward behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some points last week I figured enough was enough, and I wanted to see what would happen, so after reading various points about self-hypnosis techniques (in addition to conscious autosuggestion à la Coué), resolved to give it a shot. My initial experiences were... interesting. I&amp;#39;ve been able to relax (or I should say &amp;#39;concentrate on relaxing&amp;#39;) to the point of what I have now discovered is called catalepsy for years, I think, so that wasn&amp;#39;t a problem. Using mental imagery, I was able to suggest to myself to relax my mind a little and let go of a lot of surface tension. Of course, random thoughts and images continuously occur, and I&amp;#39;m always consciously aware, I just try to focus my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I had what felt like a revelation at one point, where I realised that my perception and memory of the way I was when I was younger was holding me back from embracing the potential for growth and positive change in the present, and my fear of change was a byproduct of my experiences of others changing but that didn&amp;#39;t mean I had to hold myself back, trying to recreate an ideal, instead of realising that the future wasn&amp;#39;t as set in stone as I believed it was, and whatever I imagined myself to be I could make happen. Suggestions seemed to come to me intuitively, without really thinking - I want to be more confident, to be more socially skilled, to be more organised and proactive in the way that I approach things. I let myself imagine it and believe it was true. It was quite emotional, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next few days, there really was a massive difference - whether because I was consciously following the suggestion or because my subconscious was somehow impacted, I can&amp;#39;t say. Perhaps both? I&amp;#39;m honestly happy with not knowing, because the only way for me to know would, paradoxically, be for me to have amnesia which I definitely don&amp;#39;t want. I had a lot more motivation, I got more work done in the week than I probably did in the previous two put together, I started exercising more often, and people who know me said they noticed a positive improvement in my demeanour. It felt like instead of being trapped in a routine, everything was fresh and new, despite the only changes being internal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days, I started to slip back into more common thought/feeling patterns, which I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;m in now, for the most part. But I&amp;#39;m still tidier, I&amp;#39;m still exercising more and I&amp;#39;m still more generally personable. I think. Procrastination is a 50/50, I did lose some momentum there. I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;ve experienced a trance state yet - I would say if I have then it was probably very mild, but I might have come the closest to it last night before I went to sleep, at which point I felt a floating sensation all over my body, and while I was still consciously aware, my thoughts seemed to have a lot less &amp;#39;resistance&amp;#39; to them. So I took the opportunity to imagine myself getting up today and feeling great, and having a productive day and, for the most part, it certainly came true (I&amp;#39;m sure the improved weather helps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently reading my way through &amp;quot;The Science of Self-Hypnosis&amp;quot; by Adam Eason and it certainly makes for interesting reading material (I hate that damn lemon suggestion though! I was only reading it and... well, my salivatory response seems to have a mind of its own. Even typing this wasn&amp;#39;t the best idea.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t so much want to learn how to put others into hypnosis, just improve my own proficiency in the area. Do any others have experiences and recommendations? I&amp;#39;ve seen Mike Mandel mentioned, as well as Igor Ledochowski. Is it just a matter of practice, and - well, belief? Ultimately I suppose it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s purely placebo as long as it&amp;#39;s making a positive impact, but even that is intrinsically related, I guess...?&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"  

Hello friends, I’ve come to you to seek aid, as many before me have. In my quest to go down the rabbit hole of the mind, the adventures of hypnotism, I’ve faced many hurdles, most of which I have yet to overcome. So, in my time of great need, I come to this subreddit in search of salvation.

Ok I’m done with overly dramatic tone now. I know how common posts like these are… “I can’t be hypnotized!” “I’m too analytical!” “I can’t go into trance!” “Why does hypnosis not work on me!?”. And I assume most of you are mostly fed up with these types of posts, wondering why these people can’t just read any of the previous similar posts to get their answer. And while I can very well see the annoyance such a repetitive question can bring, I would argue that it is indeed justifiable. 

The issue of having a hard time with hypnosis might be similar, but vastly varying in severity and personal circumstances. While yes, I could read one of the already posted queries about this very topic, which I’ve done extensively, that person isn’t me. His experiences are just slightly different, he might have issues in areas different than mine, or have circumstances that do not match mine. These differences lead someone who may be experiencing similar issues to post about it regardless of its repetitiveness, feeling it justified as they want an answer pertaining to their specific circumstances…. The lazy bastards! Which is why I am here, to shamelessly continue this trend, with my own slight little twist.

To give you context, I’ve been interested in hypnosis for a very long time, I’ve hypnotized my friends before but I’ve yet to experience induced trance for myself. The one friend I had who was most interested in it, someone who was previously hypnotized by a hypnotist which lead to the beginning of our own little shenanigans, could never bring himself to actually attempt to hypnotize me. He’d always laugh midway and have trouble improvising on the spot. Looking back it at now, after all I’ve been through, I’m doubtful he would’ve succeeded anyway, but that’s all well and done. After this I’d attempted to achieve (induced) trance myself. Flocking to many files and videos in order to experience the wonders of the mind. Only to be disappointed by lack of success… 

This led me to research a lot. Can everyone be hypnotized? Mostly yes. Is trance natural? Yes, you go in and out of trance all the time, something which after it was pointed out to me I’ve noticed a lot. And I kept going down the rabbit hole that is understanding hypnosis. 

After (very little) time I’d heard about analytical minds. I’ve always considered myself more analytical than creative or suggestable, so I’d assumed that was my case. So I tried a suggestibility test, the good ol’ magnets on your stretched hands, and to my surprise, it worked! I could literally feel the magnetic fields between my hands, my palms moving ever so slowly closer and closer. Yes, it was very slow and yes it took a while for my palms to finally meet but the fact that I could even feel the imaginary magnetic fields was a surprise on its own! 

Ok, so maybe I’m not as analytical as I think I am? Well what other factors are there? To understand that question, I had to boil down what my problem was exactly, and to do that, I had a lot of testing to do. It was time to listen to some more hypnotic files, and listen I did. Here are my experiences…

When it comes to inductions that aim to relax you, I do usually get very relaxed, the longer the induction is the more relaxed I usually get. I have a hard time defining what “relaxed” actually is. To me, my body usually feels very heavy and almost numb, while my mental state is mostly unaffected, often needing me to wrangle it back to the hypnotist’s voice in order to not get lost in my own thoughts. I don’t have too much trouble emptying myself of thoughts either, although it does take a lot of focus. Mirroring the hypnotists’ words in my head usually keeps me in my tracks but “focus” hasn’t really been the main issue for me as far as I’m aware. And it does make me wonder if it keeps my brain too active.

Over time I’ve noticed small reactions… Sometimes a loud “Sleep!” accompanied by a snap or loud noise does send a jolt through me, but has never made me feel any less conscious than I already felt. I’ve never had any issues with relaxing specific parts of my body like some other people have, and the suggestion of feeling specific parts of my body get heavier usually works (although I do speculate there is some trickery going on there with that specific suggestion).

There was one time where I “””””might””””” have went into trance? I was very tired and as far as I was concerned, I very could have fallen asleep, it doesn’t help that the file I was listening to was a simple relaxation file with no obvious signs for me to verify it’s success. But that’s about it. I’ve never had an automatic reaction because of a suggestion. I’ve never followed a hypnotist’s suggestion unconsciously without having to think about it and consciously perform it. And any suggestion outside my control such as amnesia and hallucinations have had no success.

In going through this subreddit, I’ve of course encountered the light switch technique, which I haven’t invested enough time into to verify it’s success but I do find interesting nonetheless.

This leads me to my next course of action. Why I  am making this post. Well, I want to actively try to make change. This has resulted in what I like to dub the:  
 Ultimate Training my Brain into Tricking Itself Program! Or TBTI for short (name is a work in progress..)

Throughout two weeks I want to actively train my brain to respond to hypnosis better, and I’m going to posting progress updates each day on this subreddit to document my development. And for this to work, I need your help.   
 

I’d like to ask you sorcerers of the mind what you believe would help me achieve this goal, and what I should include in my routine during those 14 days. My end goal is to hopefully have verifiable, testable proof that my brain has become more suggestable. I want to experience an automatic response to hypnotic suggestion, whether it be post-hypnotic or during hypnosis. Now I understand that 14 days is pretty short, but I probably will continue even after it’s over, 14 days is just convenient with my current schedule and with the goal of documentation. I hope you don’t find my request too abnoxious and that you could aid me in my quest. And the little progress reports might prove entertaining for some.

,hypnosis,"My partner and I are trying hypnosleep.  We've tried for two nights in a row.  Here's how things are going...

**Night 1**

After trying to find some video help, and with some friendly help from Reddit, I'd though I'd give it a go.  The first phrase I was going to say was, ""This is /u/changingcontent. You can hear me but you won't wake up."" I got as far as, ""This is /u/changingcontent.""

At that point my partner hade a heart attack and was instantly awake. She figured out what had happened pretty quickly (it is with consent and she was aware that I was going to try it).  The problem was that I was way too loud, though I thought I was talking in a quiet voice.

We broke down laughing at their extreme reaction.

**Night 2**

I warned /u/mypartner (not their real name) that I was going to try again. We'd already organised that, if they were to wake up, they'd tell me immediately. I've got some fun suggestions lined up and I don't want the surprise to be ruined.

This time I was MUCH quieter - barely a whisper.  I tried it twice.  The first time they came awake almost instantly.

I woke up around 3.00am and decided to try again.  This time I got a bit further.  The suggestion I'd planned on give was/is, ""Tomorrow you'll wake up convinced I've given you a hypnotic suggestion you can't remember. The more I deny it, the more you'll be convinced I did.""

I got as far as, ""Tomorrow you'll wake up convinced I've given you a hypnotic suggestion."" Then they told me they were awake.

The next morning they asked me if I'd given them a suggestion. I'm counting it as a partial success.

**Notes**

* I think my partner will get used to this and eventually learn to block it out. Then we'll see if anything sticks.

* If you're going to try this, you need to be quiet. Real quiet.  About as loud as their breathing or slightly louder.  I time my talking to be in between breathes.

* I've never heard her breathing get as slow as it is meant to - 6-8 breathes/minute. I've tried pacing and leading breathing but it doesn't really work that I can see.

* I can't imaging trying this on someone without consent. It is too tricky. The risk of getting caught is just massive. If you're interested in trying this out, get consent so you don't ruin your relationship.  Anyway, as they say, 'be excellent to each other'.

,hypnosis,"So I am not a hypnotist, nor do I know much about the mechanisms at play with hypnosis. However, I am into a lot of the stuff that mainstream society calls “woo woo” (I know woo woo is getting more common tho) so I’ve delved into some areas that have a bit of overlap with hypnosis. 

However, recently Ive tried a few guided hypnosis sessions that I found in various places online and on an app I found. I’ve used imagery and have been guided further into my subconscious than I think I’ve ever experienced(barring early childhood).

They are definitely not images that are “drawings” of obvious animals or objects. They almost remind me more of images of cuneiform that I’ve seen in my college classes than “hieroglyphs” , and they kinda also look like Japanese characters. But again I could not understand these symbols, at least not in any ‘logical’ way. 

In both experiences I saw lines of these characters, as you might see on an ancient tablet, except they had a glowing type of look and weren’t transcribed on anything.

,hypnosis,"So this all started when them and I were talking about how they’d want to forget their dead name after they do a legal name change, and so they wanted to do some practice amnesia suggestions in order to get better at it because apparently they “suck at amnesia hypnosis”. So at first they decided that they wanted to forget that their ex really liked lizards because it was annoying for them to have them be associated with someone so negative, and I thought it was a great idea. A couple days later I asked them if they tried the practice amnesia suggestion and they couldn’t remember us even talking about it. So I figured that probably meant that was a success and I resolved to test them by asking about their associations with lizards later. Then very shortly after that I sent them a message that had some typing similarities to their ex’s typing style, and this gave them an anxiety attack and I was very worried about them. Two hours later they came back and them and I talked all night to help them feel better about it and also to work on finding a way for me to avoid making that mistake in the future. As far as I can tell that was the last time they ever mentioned their ex. So I assume they forgot her either that night or the following day. The following day they were deleting files from their computer and so I assume they decided to delete any files that had associations with her. 

It wasn’t until yesterday (about a week later) that I brought up the name of their ex again. They were talking about their past crushes and relationships and for some reason omitted the only person who they had actually called their ex before this. And I thought there was some technicality that I was missing at first but then when they continue talking about it I say “oh, and *insert name of ex here*”. And their response is “who?” At this point I wasn’t really sure what was happening but after about a minute I asked them if they had used hypnosis to forget the person. They said maybe because of course they wouldn’t remember if they had done it. And then initially I was concerned because they had told me they would never willingly forget any of these 3 people and their ex was one of them. They decided to do that because they felt the negative experiences are important for them to remember. So at first I asked if they might’ve accidentally done it but they assured me there was no way that that could be accidental. So I believe them because they are the hypnosis expert, but they felt like the entire conversation was kinda gaslighty and they didn’t like being reminded of anything they tried to forget so they deleted the entire conversation on their end. Then after that we got into a vc because I had asked for that earlier and I naturally ask them if they are okay and they aren’t sure why I’m asking, and after a few exchanges I realized they literally forgot the entire conversation we had minutes ago. I then absolutely cannot handle how jarring this whole thing is and I start asking more and more questions.

So I end up learning that the entire year that they had they had the relationship was apparently very lonely which was good because they liked being able to focus on themself. Which all makes sense but me knowing the context of them having had that relationship I know that the reason they were so lonely was because their ex was very very controlling and didn’t want them to interact with any other people. Then they tell me about the summer after that year (this was all highschool btw but not very long ago) when they were cheated on and then broken up with. That summer was originally the worst summer of their entire life they had horrible depression, heartbreak, and they were being super emotionally manipulated by their ex and their ex’s new girlfriend to the point where they attempted suicide by stepping out into traffic. But now that summer is an enjoyable memory and a time they want to go back to. Even weirder I learn about these new crushes they had during that summer and at the end of that summer and at first I thought they might be substituted for the actual person but no they even have real photographs associated with them and they are completely different people. They and I are asexual and during that year their ex was making them do sexual role play over messages which made them think that they were allo sexual. But now they just randomly thought they were allo sexual and don’t know why. Even more they told me they learned how to pick up on other people’s emotions from their ex but now it’s just a thing they can do. And I have no idea how but everything with any association to her is completely gone except for this one animation that they did for an online friend a long time ago (the friend is the person and I know because they shared the same username as the person the animation was for).

Now I’m very happy for them because I wanted them to be able to be free of these three people when caused them all of these painful memories and feelings. The issue is the person they chose to forget is also the one person that I actually bonded with them over. Because my ex was very controlling and manipulative to me too and I remember it feeling very nice to be able to relate to them on that level because it felt nice for them to know what I’ve been through and support me with that. It was also the way that they fell in love with their ex and the way they felt their feelings that initially made me realize that I am in love with them. And also there was the fact that this person had made them feel like they had essentially taken away their place for the person who was supposed to be the only ever to have sex with. And it was reassuring to me because those feelings were something that made me feel better about my ex having taken that from me. I was able to know that my enbyfriend went through this same thing and they were able to come out doing well anyway. It also feels wrong because the depression and heartbreak were described as the worst experiences of their life just like how I had the worst experiences of my life. And both of our experiences were supposed to be something that neither of us could ever have anything worse than. And now I’m here knowing I’ve been through the worst I ever will but they are not and I’ve lost that thing that was nice to be able to relate to them on. Also a lot of our bonding before we got together was over their ex and so it feels like that bonding time is relevant anymore.

Anyway with all of that said I am at the reason I made this post. I need to know how to deal with all of this. They didn’t tell me they were going to do this beforehand so now I’m left here forced to deal with this crazy new situation. And to make things worse every time I bring it up which has been 4, 2 yesterday and 2 today have ended with them feeling upset because they feel like I’m telling them their life is incorrect. And I keep on affirming to them that their life if correct and that all of their experiences are there own and that there is nothing wrong with any of it and that it is for the better that they forgot this person and more. But they keep asking me why I’d even bring it up if their life is all good. But I can never tell them the full extent of how much this affects me because I know that will just hurt them even more. I know they will forget every time I bring it up as they must’ve implemented something to forget anything related to this as they have forgotten the conversation every time. But still, it is very difficult. Normally when I’m troubled or upset with something my go to person is them, but the more I go to them about this the more they are hurt. And tonight I asked them if it would be okay for them and I to just have a time where we can talk about this so that way I can be at ease about this whole thing and so we can both feel normal again. I also told them that if they absolutely don’t want to talk about this ever again they can say the word and I’ll find a way to deal with this on my own. They didn’t give me either answer and simply asked to leave. I know they will forget about this all, and I know they will be okay, but I still don’t want to ask them again to find out if they would be willing to help me. I came here to ask for advice on this whole thing. Should I ask again, should I try to find any other way to help myself? Have any of you gone through something similar? Is there anything that I can use that works? We are currently long distance due to COVID so is there any way to make this easier with long distance? Or is there something I’ve forgot to ask that is also super relevant to share?

Anyway thank you so much for reading this all and I really hope I can be pointed in the right direction. I never want to be in a position where I feel bad and am stuck with the dilemma of asking the person who cares most about me for help and making them feel bad or hiding it and trying to power through on my own.

Edit: Wow I just had them talk to me about a character that they really relate to because of the relationship with their ex. And well now the character is still one they relate to but the reasons are so much weaker which just makes it feel so odd.

Edit 2: I think I’ve fully realized why they decided to forget their ex now. And wow does it make me feel loved. Basically I realized they likely forgot her because they wanted me to be the only person to ever make them feel this special, because sure they felt it all over again but it was nothing new before. Now it’s everything new and I love them so much for making me their one true love and removing the other person who they once thought was. I just wish I could thank them for putting me first in so many ways. It genuinely makes me feel so loved and special.",t2_74sp71lz,False,,0,False,How do I deal with and get used to my partner forgetting their ex girlfriend with hypnosis and the two of us knowing drastically different things about certain portions of their life?,[],r/hypnosis,False,6,,0,,False,t3_mdk6q1,False,dark,0.6,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,1616841976.0,,[],{},,True,,1616776896.0,text,6,,,text,self.hypnosis,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this all started when them and I were talking about how they’d want to forget their dead name after they do a legal name change, and so they wanted to do some practice amnesia suggestions in order to get better at it because apparently they “suck at amnesia hypnosis”. So at first they decided that they wanted to forget that their ex really liked lizards because it was annoying for them to have them be associated with someone so negative, and I thought it was a great idea. A couple days later I asked them if they tried the practice amnesia suggestion and they couldn’t remember us even talking about it. So I figured that probably meant that was a success and I resolved to test them by asking about their associations with lizards later. Then very shortly after that I sent them a message that had some typing similarities to their ex’s typing style, and this gave them an anxiety attack and I was very worried about them. Two hours later they came back and them and I talked all night to help them feel better about it and also to work on finding a way for me to avoid making that mistake in the future. As far as I can tell that was the last time they ever mentioned their ex. So I assume they forgot her either that night or the following day. The following day they were deleting files from their computer and so I assume they decided to delete any files that had associations with her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until yesterday (about a week later) that I brought up the name of their ex again. They were talking about their past crushes and relationships and for some reason omitted the only person who they had actually called their ex before this. And I thought there was some technicality that I was missing at first but then when they continue talking about it I say “oh, and &lt;em&gt;insert name of ex here&lt;/em&gt;”. And their response is “who?” At this point I wasn’t really sure what was happening but after about a minute I asked them if they had used hypnosis to forget the person. They said maybe because of course they wouldn’t remember if they had done it. And then initially I was concerned because they had told me they would never willingly forget any of these 3 people and their ex was one of them.

,hypnosis,"I can’t find the YT video now, but I saw a street hypnosis demo where a hypnotist eliminated the number “9” from the participant’s vocabulary. The participant then counted 11 fingers instead of 10. The audience loved it. I liked it too. That exercise serves as proof that the participant entered trance successfully and that *hypnosis* *works*. 

Another way to confirm whether a subject enters trance is with an EEG machine which is quite pricey and not practical for me or anyone really. There are cheap alternatives - - headbands which measure brain waves but their true functionality is highly questionable.

I’ve taken Steven Burns’ Udemy course titled, “[Self-Hypnosis Mastery: Hypnosis for Personal Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/self-hypnosis-mastery-hypnosis-for-personal-development)”. I took 50 pages of notes and have been practicing hypnosis (while also journaling) with my primary intention to improve my self discipline. I have achieved modest success with a notable increase in my daily activities, however I can’t determine if my improved self discipline is the direct result of my self-hypnosis practice or just a correlation with me just building better habits in general. I remain curious: What auto-suggestions might you folks recommend that I could try to confirm that I am entering trance successfully?

If measuring brain waves isn’t workable from my home using a tool, there must be a technique or intention I can set to verify after I exit trance that self-hypnosis works.

How can I prove that I have entered trance during my self-hypnosis practice? 

Steven Burns’ course doesn’t have a module for this in the course I took so here I am reaching out to the community on reddit.

,hypnosis,"📌 I have seen some people saying that they can't get into a deep trance state because they don't respond to suggestions. However, in my opinion, these two things are not necessarily related.... And I think it would be nice to discuss this with you.

First, I would like to share some facts about myself that may be relevant to understand my point of view:

1. When I was a child I used to challenge myself to stay a few minutes without thinking. And, with some practice, I have managed to greatly increase the time I can stay in this state. Today I interpret this as a kind of self-hypnosis.

2. Because of my job, I need to concentrate for long periods, achieving flowstate, which is quite natural for me now.

3. I also feel that I can achieve a similar state of ""focus"" with hypnosis.

Because of this, I conclude that I am susceptible to hypnosis.

Now, I'd like to share how I feel about suggestibility: I don't think my Mind is open to hypnotic suggestions, I mean, suggestions are always very conscious for me, and the effect of it is the same as if, for example, someone directly asks me ""would you like to drink a glass of water?"" And I will only answer ""yes"" if I am thirsty. In my case, it really doesn't work like a “seed” in the other way around: I won't feel thirsty because it was suggested to me and I won't drink a glass of water. 

So, I see hypnosis and suggestibility as *very* distinct things.

That said, why do people and (especially scientists) measure how deep the subject was (or hypnotic susceptibility) through suggestibility? Of course, one of the major goals of hypnosis is, indeed, to give suggestions, and for that specific purpose, measuring hypnotisability through susceptibility to suggestions makes a lot of sense. (*sorry for the tongue twister!*) But, more broadly, it doesn't seem very scientifically correct to me that something that may be as poor as just a *possible* consequence is being used as a thermometer of cause...!

&lt;p&gt;That said, why do people and (especially scientists) measure how deep the subject was (or hypnotic susceptibility) through suggestibility? Of course, one of the major goals of hypnosis is, indeed, to give suggestions, and for that specific purpose, measuring hypnotisability through susceptibility to suggestions makes a lot of sense. (&lt;em&gt;sorry for the tongue twister!&lt;/em&gt;) But, more broadly, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem very scientifically correct to me that something that may be as poor as just a &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; consequence is being used as a thermometer of cause...! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your opinion about this? 🧠&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"Hello, long time lurker, first time poster.

**Preface:**

I have an incredible overactive and analytical mind. I have difficulty switching off (to put it lightly), and sleep problems because of this. Fairly controlling personality type too, but nothing extreme, i just like knowing whats going on. I also have difficulty visualising to an extent, i dont have much of a mind's eye, and i dont dream, or rather, it was only up until recently i realised that people do *actually* dream when they sleep, and can remember what happened. I thought it was just a figure of speech... :(

I have a deep interest in hypnosis. The stories i hear, the experiences people report back on are incredibly enticing.

They experienced profound calmness? Their mind just relaxed? wake up feeling refreshed? I really really need/want that. That sounds amazing, and just about the coolest thing i can imagine!

...It also sounds totally alien to me. How on earth does that happen?

**History with hypnosis:**

Since my newfound interest in this hobby many months ago now, Ive read literally everything i can my hands on, many books, articles, peer reviewed journals, user experiences etc (see: overactive analytical mind). Lurking on reddit it one of those facets of research. Ive gone through the sidebar thouroughly and the history.

I took it upon myself to download some audio, listen to some youtubes and see what it was all about.

It quickly became apparent that being hypnotised is going to be very difficult for me. After each failed session, i analysed why i think it didnt work. Common threads were:

\- thing took too long, got bored

\- distracted

\- too much visualisation

However, undettered, i searched and have found several inductions which are fairly fast (sub 5 and 10 mins), dont require much visualisation, and more importantly, that i felt a \*twinge\* of doing something.

I have since stuck to those inductions/files, and practiced and practiced and practiced.

**How hypnosis goes for me:**

I get nice and relaxed. I have never ever found it hard to physically relax, relaxing whole body and feeling heavy and numb is dead easy. I have never once experienced tingling in the toes or any other such suggestions while relaxing, but i dont think thats important. I can get my breathing steady, and my body still and calm fairly quickly and easily.

Now, its time to actually get into the mind relaxing stage, whether that be a countdown, stairs, whatever. Heres where the problem is, and where my questions come from.

I am wide awake from now until the end of the file listening to the voice in the file. I am not at all silent in my mind, im analyzing literally every word, any suggestion that is made. Shortly after the induction, there is a fairly lengthy deepener (which i think help for me), but the voice might be something like ""your mind is totally calm and sleeping and still"", and im literally ""yeah, but its not tho is it :D"". And im like this to the end of the file, or i just choose to get up cos im clearly bored and ive heard this file many times before. At no point do any suggestions do anything at all, and often i just groan and get sad when one comes in, because im just sat there wide awake with my eys closed, aware now that this is just a dead session.

Undaunted i have tried several things to quell my conscious cynical idiot brain. I have separated my trials into three categories:

1. Listen as closely as you can to the words being said by the hypnotist.

This method is a dead loss. If im listening, the great eye of sauron is gazing directly at every single thing that is being said, and analyzing it in real time. When i do this i often feel myself going ""you hear that? use of inferance you see? they said *when* you fall asleep, not a direct suggestion because direct suggestion is difficult, thats why you chose this file, we smart!""

2) Attempt to listen to the *sound* of the audio, but not pay attention to the words themselves.

Now this is something that i feel has legs, but unsure. When i do this, i find my mind snapping back occasionally to the words (see:great eye of sauron), and as soon as that happens, im out of the session. Done. I can only sustain this for maybe 30 seconds, before the conscious mind *has* to be doing something. And more often than not, this is where i snap out, as a sad panda :(

3) Dont listen to anything at all that the person is saying, just ignore it and think of something else instead.

Also not sure, but think this may have legs for me. I focus on my breathing and nothing else, or focus on some fantasy type scenario (this is difficult for me, see: problems visualising). I find i cant just focus on the blackness on the back of my eyes because its not enough to distract my conscious from whats being said.

Now, using method 2 and 3, i have actually experienced here and there, a zoomed in sort of focus for approx 1 second at a time. This has happened maybe a dozen times in 3 months, for a total of about 12 seconds of focus time :D

What normally happens when this happens is: I consciously think, ""woohoo, this feels like something could be happening :DDDD"", at which point it immediately stops and goes away and im a sad panda again.

Or the eye of sauron comes back, or whatever. One way or another, it doesnt sustain for more than a moment.

Additionally, when these moments happen, i get crosseyed or severe actually really uncomfortable eye flutters/scrunched eyes. Eyes are shut ofc, but it gives me a headache within seconds cos eyes are all over the place.

**Questions to the audience:**

Do my three trial groups at all represent what i *should* be doing when trying to be hypnotised?

If not, what do *you* do when trying to be hypnotised? Have i missed a beat here? im really hoping i have and someone say ""yo, what are you doing, why not do this instead lol"". If it turns out im being an idiot and missed something obvious, thats actually best case scenario for me at the moment and i would love to hear it :)

It feels like to me that the conscious mind simply will not switch off, and it absolutely will not let what is supposed to happen, happen. I worked this out early on and tried a bunch of confusion inductions, but it just ate them for lunch :/ I think the best solution to this is get the conscious mind focused on something else entirely, and get it far away from the action. Does anyone else think this could be the problem, and if you do, have any ideas as to what i can focus the conscious mind on?

Several times i have felt a zoomed in focus appear to come over me before it fades within an instant. What should i be doing when this happens? This is the only effect that has ever happened while listening to any file, and it happens rarely and for a split second, so im certain this must be the right string to pull on so to speak.

Is there anything else i can be doing to become a better hypnotic subject?

&amp;#x200B;

On a side note, I have no real interest in becoming a hypnotist myself. Mostly desperate to experience this tranquil place that others seem to achieve so easily :(

If you got through that damn essay then i thank you. Any suggestions or thoughts that might help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance. :)

,hypnosis,"In my city there are many hypnotists and hypnotherapists. Many claim to help in cutting off cigarettes and weight loss. A vast majority assist in cutting bad habits and this attracts many folk. 

I tend to notice that many of these professionals have flaws themselves. For example I went to a hypnotists who claims to help folks lose weight and cut off junk food but they themselves are overweight and sometimes obese. 

So the question comes to mind, how do you expect to help someone when you yourself are in the same position? Why do you not use this technique to better your life. 

I've always heard the counter argument, ""well, many doctors are unhealthy and obese but people still go to doctors."" Well, if I'm in the midst of an infection I can go to a doctor and he will prescribe me some antibiotics which are PROVEN to work. Many studies find it works. Also, it's not like the doc has an infection himself. Don't get me started on surgery. 

Hypnosis isn't taught to med students regularly because results are often times inconclusive. Some doctors learn and use it but it's not the standard for treating unhealthy people. If hypnosis worked, then doctors wouldn't be using suboxone to treat opioid addicts. Suboxone itself is an opioid and I've heard an internist once tell me that we have no choice, these folks will die. 

I'm just tired of seeing articles and hypnotist advertising why hypnosis works. I've shelled out over 1000 dollars so far and none of the sessions worked. You people charge more than a doctor who went to school for 12 years. You free us with false hopes and delusions of grandeur. I've been told from neuroscientists that the fundamental foundation of hypnosis aims to get to your subconscious. How does one expect to get to the part of their brain that controls breathing and other automatic mechanisms. It's more complex than what hypnotist tell us. 

Just remember, addicts wouldn't exist if hypnosis and hypnotherapy was really effective. My friend died of heroin overdose. I took him to many hypnotherapists. He was willing to quit and tried his best. He briefly stopped but would always go back after several months. He couldn't quit. We tried rehab and that worked more effectively than regular hypnotherapy treatment. 


I've now come across something called transcranial magnetic stimulation and the research shows some promise. As of now it helps treat depression but many scientists say the root cause of addiction is always something like depression caused by trauma. My buddy was molested as young kid. Apparently many hypnotherapists claimed that they can dull that memory or reduce the effects it gives him subconsciously so he can remain calm.

I apologise if I am not clear in what I am asking, but I am hoping you can all help with some random Q's that have been running around in my head recently. I am using some self-hypnosis apps to try help out with some issues I have (nightmares, procrastination etc). I feel it is helping but I would like to know what I can do to make a session more effective. Things that occur to me sometimes:

1. Should I listen carefully to the words or try to zone out?
2. Should I avoid thinking of anything else, or should I just just let my mind go where it goes?
3. Sometime I get little movies running while I have my eyes closed - should I try ignore them or try see them better?
4. Are there any tips or tricks that those who get hypnotised use to help themselves go under?

On a different note - my wife is going to try use the app as well due to some recent sleep issue. She is a little nervous about it.

,hypnosis,"I just saw /u/TistDaniel's thread: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/m00h4f/hypnotized_against_my_will_posts/

and /u/SabinBC made the suggestion that we should compile resources, methods and directions into a single place.

Before we write something long, and put it on the wiki, I thought it'd be a good idea to post this here, for public discussion. I'm sure /u/TistDaniel is going to have a lot of scientific papers to add to this. I've been away for a while, however I'm confident others also will have some input on these matters, that should be taken into account for our wiki page on this.

Consider this a first draft for a general resource on dealing with hypnosis-adjacent trauma.

*Note that this is my model, what I use to think of the human being. As someone who's suffering from C-PTSD, this might be a useful perspective. This is written for the unlucky victims, not those who want to learn how to perform hypnosis.* 

## What Is Hypnosis, Anyway?

Hypnosis, conventionally, is thought of as ""bypassing the critical faculty of the conscious mind.""

However, what does that actually mean? What *is* the conscious mind?

Let's explore that a little. 

First and foremost, we've got consciousness, or awareness. It is the unchanging observer. It has no qualities, no properties. Its only ability is to be aware. (Cf. Patanjali's *Yoga Sutra* for an excellent rundown on consciousness.)

Secondly, we have the environment that consciousness resides in. This, is a whole thing. The sum total. The ""world"" you are aware of, taken as *one thing.* This is where emotions, feelings are. Attitudes. 

Feeling is fundamental to existence. 

Where consciousness is aware of its environment, there are two resulting things. 

1. Individuation (i.e. the body we have)
2. Mentation (i.e. the thoughts we have)

Both of these are functions of feeling, and emotion. Individuation - subdivisions of the world consciousness is aware of.

The important part is that the feelings we're focusing our awareness on very literally shapes our thinking and behavior.

Conversely, the feelings we're avoiding being aware of, also shape our thinking and behavior.

The way hypnosis works, in this model, is to make the hypnotee become aware of feelings. Behaviors and thought patterns naturally follow from that. 

A lot of studies have been done, and it appears that about 15-20% of the population is highly susceptible to being hypnotized, some 60-70% are moderate, and 15-20% are very difficult to hypnotize.

This means that the average person has a roughtly 1/6 chance of being vulnerable.

But what does vulernability actually mean in this case?

The studies I've seen on the matter have always focused on the brain, rather than on whether their subjects were consistently suppressing their feelings, such as people with emotional difficulties, trauma survivors, etc.

From experience, *I know* that this is how it works. However, that's just my experience, and while I can back it up with lots of stories, that's anecdotal.

As someone who has struggled with emotions for a long time, discovering this has been a game-changer, in terms of self-hypnosis and self-change.

In any case, getting back on topic. Fundamentally, hypnosis is having one's awareness captured, and guided towards feelings of one sort or another.

Given that these are reactions to environmental cues, it is difficult to avoid, unless one has practice suppressing their feelings and thoughts.

Here's a reasonable intro to these ideas:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_suppression

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-monitoring

## What's Abuse?

For the purposes of clarity, and because that's the type of abuse I've seen most often, I'll equate ""abuse"" with ""things that result in trauma"", or PTSD.

There is most often a very clear ""before"" and ""after."" To these things.

Trauma, in so many ways, can result from:
- Neglect
- Withdrawal of affection
- Verbal abuse
- Emotional abuse (!)
- Gaslighting
- Lying
- Violence
- Breaking taboos
- Meeting death
- Experiencing painful memories (re-traumatization)
- Undermining the subject's sense of self
- Undermining the subject's trust in their own senses and feelings
- etc. etc.

Trauma can also *occur retroactively.*

Someone can happily participate in a very psychologically extreme situation, only to realize that they broke multiple taboos of their own, later. 

Re-traumatization is also difficult, as in trying to get help, the victim can be faced with ""professionals"" saying ""nah this is impossible you're making it up."" I've seen a good number of hypnotists do just that in this subreddit. Supposed professionals who clearly haven't lifted a finger to verify what they say.

The effects of trauma vary, but if you look through our community here, it's easy to notice that the pattern does indeed fit PTSD. 

Hypnosis is merely a catalyst for it. Most people don't realize just how delicate, and fragile, human feelings are. How sensitive we all are. That's a societal problem, as we've all developed defenses and thick walls to keep the bad feelings away.

But hypnosis takes those walls down for a lot of people. It lowers their guard, and then they end up betrayed by the person they trusted with their heart.

Hypnotic trauma is as serious as anything else. It makes life miserable, and has compounding effects on a person's life.

## What NOT to do?

**First** and foremost, avoid using hypnosis, and hypnotists in an attempt to ""fix it."" This is *de facto* trauma, and you should treat it as such - using psychotherapy, self-reflection, and kindness. These are feelings, emotions, not some dry and abstract ""program"" installed in your head.

**Secondly**, avoid psychedelics (LSD, MDMA, shrooms) as a solution. It *can* help, however you could also find yourself completely overwhelmed by these feelings, and end up doing something really stupid trying to escape them. If you want to go that way, find a psychological clinic which offers psychedelic therapy. Anything less is plain irresponsible.

**Third**, and arguably **most important - be kind to yourself.** It is easy to gaslight *yourself* by pretending that the problem doesn't exist. ""It wasn't that bad."" Then why the shaking? Why the nightmares? Why the emotional insecurity? Why is the sleep cycle out of whack? Why the *distress?*

## What SHOULD you do?

**First**, learn enough about hypnosis to be able to convey what the mechanism of action is to whoever is helping you through this experience. Emotional support is important. If you have family, friends, or someone else you can rely on to be there for you, that you can talk to about these things, use them.

**Second**, meditate. Zazen is superior to everything else for this purpose, as it trains your ability to *just be* with yourself. If you find your mind wandering, you can focus on your breath. Count each inhalation up to 10, and start again. If you find yourself losing numbers, re-start. Over time, do less, and less, until you're only sitting.

You may find that hurt surfaces when you're sitting. This is normal, and expected. You're wounded, and it's important to acknowledge that. However, the hurt does go away if you sit more. A good attitude for sitting, from my own experience, is ""this too shall pass.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikantaza

**Third**, if you want something more intense, pick up Christopher Hyatt's ""Undoing Yourself WIth Energized Meditation."" It combines some of the above, with intentional chaos. Stress, tensions, and trauma are stored in the musculature. By disrupting these, you can stir the mind, and address these things as they surface.

https://archive.org/details/HyattChristopher-TheBlackBookVolumeI-vthePsychopathsNotebook/HyattChristopher-08-UndoingYourselfWithEnergizedMeditationAndOtherDevices/mode/2up

There are three exercises in the book, that are important. You can ignore most everything else, however I still recommend reading it - it gives a lot of context to what it is we're pursuing here.

**Fourth**, if you are in a position to - get therapy, ideally with someone trained in trauma counseling. 

**Fifth**, realize that people who have letters next to their names more often than not have less clue than those who have experienced these things. Namely, *you*. 

## In summary

Be kind to yourself. 

There's a lot more that can be written. However, this is a foundation, and should be a good start for us to expand on.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/m00h4f/hypnotized_against_my_will_posts/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/m00h4f/hypnotized_against_my_will_posts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;a href=""/u/SabinBC""&gt;/u/SabinBC&lt;/a&gt; made the suggestion that we should compile resources, methods and directions into a single place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we write something long, and put it on the wiki, I thought it&amp;#39;d be a good idea to post this here, for public discussion. I&amp;#39;m sure &lt;a href=""/u/TistDaniel""&gt;/u/TistDaniel&lt;/a&gt; is going to have a lot of scientific papers to add to this. I&amp;#39;ve been away for a while, however I&amp;#39;m confident others also will have some input on these matters, that should be taken into account for our wiki page on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this a first draft for a general resource on dealing with hypnosis-adjacent trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that this is my model, what I use to think of the human being. As someone who&amp;#39;s suffering from C-PTSD, this might be a useful perspective. This is written for the unlucky victims, not those who want to learn how to perform hypnosis.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Is Hypnosis, Anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypnosis, conventionally, is thought of as &amp;quot;bypassing the critical faculty of the conscious mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what does that actually mean? What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the conscious mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s explore that a little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, we&amp;#39;ve got consciousness, or awareness. It is the unchanging observer. It has no qualities, no properties. Its only ability is to be aware. (Cf. Patanjali&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Yoga Sutra&lt;/em&gt; for an excellent rundown on consciousness.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we have the environment that consciousness resides in. This, is a whole thing. The sum total. The &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; you are aware of, taken as &lt;em&gt;one thing.&lt;/em&gt; This is where emotions, feelings are. Attitudes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling is fundamental to existence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where consciousness is aware of its environment, there are two resulting things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuation (i.e. the body we have)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentation (i.e. the thoughts we have)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are functions of feeling, and emotion. Individuation - subdivisions of the world consciousness is aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part is that the feelings we&amp;#39;re focusing our awareness on very literally shapes our thinking and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the feelings we&amp;#39;re avoiding being aware of, also shape our thinking and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way hypnosis works, in this model, is to make the hypnotee become aware of feelings. Behaviors and thought patterns naturally follow from that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of studies have been done, and it appears that about 15-20% of the population is highly susceptible to being hypnotized, some 60-70% are moderate, and 15-20% are very difficult to hypnotize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the average person has a roughtly 1/6 chance of being vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does vulernability actually mean in this case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studies I&amp;#39;ve seen on the matter have always focused on the brain, rather than on whether their subjects were consistently suppressing their feelings, such as people with emotional difficulties, trauma survivors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From experience, &lt;em&gt;I know&lt;/em&gt; that this is how it works. However, that&amp;#39;s just my experience, and while I can back it up with lots of stories, that&amp;#39;s anecdotal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who has struggled with emotions for a long time, discovering this has been a game-changer, in terms of self-hypnosis and self-change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, getting back on topic. Fundamentally, hypnosis is having one&amp;#39;s awareness captured, and guided towards feelings of one sort or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that these are reactions to environmental cues, it is difficult to avoid, unless one has practice suppressing their feelings and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a reasonable intro to these ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_suppression""&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_suppression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-monitoring""&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#39;s Abuse?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of clarity, and because that&amp;#39;s the type of abuse I&amp;#39;ve seen most often, I&amp;#39;ll equate &amp;quot;abuse&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;things that result in trauma&amp;quot;, or PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is most often a very clear &amp;quot;before&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;after.&amp;quot; To these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trauma, in so many ways, can result from:
- Neglect
- Withdrawal of affection
- Verbal abuse
- Emotional abuse (!)
- Gaslighting
- Lying
- Violence
- Breaking taboos
- Meeting death
- Experiencing painful memories (re-traumatization)
- Undermining the subject&amp;#39;s sense of self
- Undermining the subject&amp;#39;s trust in their own senses and feelings
- etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trauma can also &lt;em&gt;occur retroactively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone can happily participate in a very psychologically extreme situation, only to realize that they broke multiple taboos of their own, later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-traumatization is also difficult, as in trying to get help, the victim can be faced with &amp;quot;professionals&amp;quot; saying &amp;quot;nah this is impossible you&amp;#39;re making it up.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve seen a good number of hypnotists do just that in this subreddit. Supposed professionals who clearly haven&amp;#39;t lifted a finger to verify what they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of trauma vary, but if you look through our community here, it&amp;#39;s easy to notice that the pattern does indeed fit PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypnosis is merely a catalyst for it. Most people don&amp;#39;t realize just how delicate, and fragile, human feelings are. How sensitive we all are. That&amp;#39;s a societal problem, as we&amp;#39;ve all developed defenses and thick walls to keep the bad feelings away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hypnosis takes those walls down for a lot of people. It lowers their guard, and then they end up betrayed by the person they trusted with their heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypnotic trauma is as serious as anything else. It makes life miserable, and has compounding effects on a person&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What NOT to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt; and foremost, avoid using hypnosis, and hypnotists in an attempt to &amp;quot;fix it.&amp;quot; This is &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; trauma, and you should treat it as such - using psychotherapy, self-reflection, and kindness. These are feelings, emotions, not some dry and abstract &amp;quot;program&amp;quot; installed in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly&lt;/strong&gt;, avoid psychedelics (LSD, MDMA, shrooms) as a solution. It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help, however you could also find yourself completely overwhelmed by these feelings, and end up doing something really stupid trying to escape them. If you want to go that way, find a psychological clinic which offers psychedelic therapy. Anything less is plain irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt;, and arguably &lt;strong&gt;most important - be kind to yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; It is easy to gaslight &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; by pretending that the problem doesn&amp;#39;t exist. &amp;quot;It wasn&amp;#39;t that bad.&amp;quot; Then why the shaking? Why the nightmares? Why the emotional insecurity? Why is the sleep cycle out of whack? Why the &lt;em&gt;distress?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What SHOULD you do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, learn enough about hypnosis to be able to convey what the mechanism of action is to whoever is helping you through this experience. Emotional support is important. If you have family, friends, or someone else you can rely on to be there for you, that you can talk to about these things, use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, meditate. Zazen is superior to everything else for this purpose, as it trains your ability to &lt;em&gt;just be&lt;/em&gt; with yourself. If you find your mind wandering, you can focus on your breath. Count each inhalation up to 10, and start again. If you find yourself losing numbers, re-start. Over time, do less, and less, until you&amp;#39;re only sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find that hurt surfaces when you&amp;#39;re sitting. This is normal, and expected. You&amp;#39;re wounded, and it&amp;#39;s important to acknowledge that. However, the hurt does go away if you sit more. A good attitude for sitting, from my own experience, is &amp;quot;this too shall pass.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikantaza""&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikantaza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt;, if you want something more intense, pick up Christopher Hyatt&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Undoing Yourself WIth Energized Meditation.&amp;quot; It combines some of the above, with intentional chaos. Stress, tensions, and trauma are stored in the musculature. By disrupting these, you can stir the mind, and address these things as they surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://archive.org/details/HyattChristopher-TheBlackBookVolumeI-vthePsychopathsNotebook/HyattChristopher-08-UndoingYourselfWithEnergizedMeditationAndOtherDevices/mode/2up""&gt;https://archive.org/details/HyattChristopher-TheBlackBookVolumeI-vthePsychopathsNotebook/HyattChristopher-08-UndoingYourselfWithEnergizedMeditationAndOtherDevices/mode/2up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three exercises in the book, that are important. You can ignore most everything else, however I still recommend reading it - it gives a lot of context to what it is we&amp;#39;re pursuing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth&lt;/strong&gt;, if you are in a position to - get therapy, ideally with someone trained in trauma counseling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fifth&lt;/strong&gt;, realize that people who have letters next to their names more often than not have less clue than those who have experienced these things. Namely, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be kind to yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot more that can be written. However, this is a foundation, and should be a good start for us to expand on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and best of luck, &lt;/p&gt;

Well in the title I assumed that Allen Carr's book is some kind of hypnosis as it felt that way to me. It helped me stop smoking, even if I was building up on quitting (within a couple of days I tried lots of different techniques, and the book was like the last hit).

,hypnosis,"Hello there.

I'm a clinical hypnotherapist that, during the ongoing COVID situation is looking to move my practice to a more virtually focused environment.  Along with doing my usual live sessions via platforms such as Discord and Skype, I'm looking to start recording some trance videos that wouldn't actually include my face (perhaps just my eyes at one point, faded out), but would more focus on having visual effects such as various spirals and tunneled focus stimuli.

The only problem here is, I've typically only done standalone voice recordings in the past and have no experience in actually making the visual components or editing in any audio (such as subliminals and background binaural beats) into videos or visual effects before.

As someone who is just starting out with this kind of thing, can anyone recommend a good starting point of the best software or tools, or even some good guides to utilize for this sort of thing that could enable me to host them on my own website, or a Patreon?  For reference only, I was planning on making both clinically therapeutic and NSFW content (to be hosted separately, obviously).

Thanks in advance for any replies or comments.

That's why I started constantly reinforcing stuff that talks about her being able to revoke consent anytime in our sessions, that she won't feel guilty if eventually bad stuff does happen while she's under (she tends to blame herself for any hypnosis related failures), reinforcing that it's okay to feel any emotion whhile under and that it's okay to communicate it to me if she wishes to, reinforcing that she need not continue with something just to please me...

The session I took her deepest she's ever been I've reinforced stuff like that among other things. Now, this may just be my worries speaking out, but does anyone have experience with suggestions like these and do they work?

Ive heard that dissociative fugue is when a person suddenly forgets his past life and associations due to a traumatic event or stress and have the urge to wandere usually far from home for a couple of months or years. (Also: If the person already started a new life it can happens that he suddenly remembers his past life again and forgets the years he lived his ‚new/fake life‘.)
This is exactly how I feel like right now... for months already. In my case it was mostly due to lots of stress from university.

This is my first foray into this subreddit. I recently figured out (yesterday) that I misplaced a pair of diamond earrings. These are not crazy expensive earrings but hold more of a sentimental value as my husband gave them to me.

I've been getting into the magical world of hypnosis and I have a few questions. This morning I was talking to a good friend who lives far away and I brought up hypnosis. He had never heard of it before, so sent him funny street videos and explained what it was. I asked him if he wanted to be my subject some time and he agreed. This will be my first time hypnotizing someone so it should be interesting. 

\-Any good pre-made scripts?

\-Can I do it over the phone?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been getting into the magical world of hypnosis and I have a few questions. This morning I was talking to a good friend who lives far away and I brought up hypnosis. He had never heard of it before, so sent him funny street videos and explained what it was. I asked him if he wanted to be my subject some time and he agreed. This will be my first time hypnotizing someone so it should be interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Any good pre-made scripts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Can I do it over the phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Any other tips?&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"I’ll preface this by saying I have already done one hypnotherapy session for birth trauma with another booked with the same practitioner next week to help deal with my anxiety about still not having a menstrual cycle at almost 12 months postpartum.

I’ve had a battery of tests due to what I can only describe as “phantom periods” that have been happening since last July. In that time I’ve drastically cut down my son’s nursing schedule. We’re down to just 2-3 sessions a day, but I’m still dealing with menstural-like cramps without bleeding every 3-4 weeks. On top of this, I’ll get days of fertile cervical fluid that make me think I’m about to ovulate, but I never do—this now happens almost weekly and it’s exhausting.

After ruling out uterine scarring, my RE said  the cramps are just my body “gearing up” to cycle again, but after 7 months of this I’m feeling depressed and hopeless. 

The night after my first hypnotherapy session, my core body temperature (I’m using a wearable called Ovusense) dropped by more than .5 degrees, which made me think that maybe I was experiencing an estrogen surge prior to ovulation. This was followed by 2 days of fertile cervical fluid, but I still failed to ovulate.

Where I made sure to    Instill that within him  and i added another trigger worr with the same rules so far it works great  it&amp;#39;s been over 3 hours and the triggers still work what they do is personal so don&amp;#39;t ask but I feel amazing   I used a strategy focusing on the power words have      And  had it.  To where first he would read then he would understand then he would feel 
 And each one was easier then the one before is his Brian shut down meow and more &lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"I learned yesterday of the existence of guided hypnosis experiences and tried a 3-hour long video, while laying in bed, that is intended to help me stay lucid while dreaming. Completely harmless goal, right?

Well, turns out that I alternated between being mildly calm, being hyped at the thought of succeeding and getting lucid dreams, and even anxious at the thought of essentially subjecting myself to mind control (although I know it's irrational to feal fear in this context, I couldn't help it.) So much so that after I estimate 1 hour of being awake I just removed my earbuds and slept on the couch to reset my weird mix of anxiety and hype and actually sleep.

As an example, at one point the voice asked  four questions (Are you awake, are you laying down, are you in your room, are you dreaming?), and said something like ""The next time I ask these questions, you will likely not be awake, nor laying down, nor be in your room."" On one hand I was hyped by the idea of hearing her and recognizing these questions, Inception-style, while dreaming. On the other, I was later freaked out by the idea that she possibly doesn't even ask those questions a second time in the video, and just plants the idea in your mind so your brain creates her asking them in your dreams.

**TL;DR:** I couldn't stay calm while trying a guided hypnosis video, but I want to pursue this. Can you give me tips to make me lower my defenses and just accept the experience?

**EDIT :** I will add that another expression of this anticipation is that every time I feel like I'm calming down, or feel in an unusual way that I believe is because of the hypnosis, this realization makes my heart skip a beat, as if I had just been startled (sometimes with the intensity of a full jump-scare).

,hypnosis,"There's been a bit of controversy on hypnosis claims to boost the immune system. I believe it can and here is why:
First, I look at what *suppresses* the immune system. Aside from chemical agents, emotional stress suppresses the immune system. What causes emotional stress? Response to our interpretation from what our senses deliver to us, and our learned beliefs from experiences and people. 

Hypnosis is a wonderful tool to change and alter all of that. For example, if you have ever felt happy, then a conditioned response can be created using hypnosis to send that feeling powerfully flowing through you, ""washing away"" negative emotions.

If you have had bad experiences (or people) you can't get past, that is a cause of negative stress (often with triggers). Hypnosis works great to eliminate the effects. If you are angry at yourself (or feel guilty) for mistakes you made, hypnosis works great to let that go.

So if you can let go of every bad experience you have ever had, and every mistake you ever made. How can that NOT reduce stress and therefore improve the immune system?

Most people think of hypnosis as direct suggestion, and those can be powerful as well for encouraging the immune system to work at its optimum. In my experience, that works best after the negative experiences, beliefs and emotions are let go.

,hypnosis,"So.... While was having a shower. A thought came to me. If you're someone who has some resistance to hypnosis, and you are like the only one awake in a room full of hypnotised people. What can you do to wake them up? 

So. What spurred this thought. You know in those movies where someone is charmed/brainwashed/hypnotised by someone evil, for example. Or in anime, fantasy, cartoon. Etc etc. 

Than for some miraculous reason, only the mc, side character. The one person who doesn't get hypnotised because they can't, or they don't. Or whatever trope reasons. Real or fake. Whatever. 

Now, common ideas they thrown around in those scenes are that if you slap them, throw water on them, light their pants on fire in one weird case, they will snap out of it. Than proceed to save the world or whatever.

Now, what I am curious is about the validity of such things. Real or fake or exaggerated. 

Let's say you (The reader)  is in a room. Some evil (somewhat for convince sake)  has all your friends under their spell. Two scenario. Scenario 1: You give them a sharp stimulus, ie pain,  to wake them up, and they do. Does this work? 

Scenario 2: whatever you do, they are still under the spell. Hypnosis. (Use your imagination). Any viable things you can do to ""snap them out of it? ""

Long post but this is something I can't help but wonder. 

Of course they are more hypothecial situations but this two are the top two bugging me.

While was having a shower. A thought came to me. If you&amp;#39;re someone who has some resistance to hypnosis, and you are like the only one awake in a room full of hypnotised people. What can you do to wake them up? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. What spurred this thought. You know in those movies where someone is charmed/brainwashed/hypnotised by someone evil, for example. Or in anime, fantasy, cartoon. Etc etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Than for some miraculous reason, only the mc, side character. The one person who doesn&amp;#39;t get hypnotised because they can&amp;#39;t, or they don&amp;#39;t. Or whatever trope reasons. Real or fake. Whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, common ideas they thrown around in those scenes are that if you slap them, throw water on them, light their pants on fire in one weird case, they will snap out of it. Than proceed to save the world or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"To start, I decided recently to try hypnotizing myself using my own voice.  Specifically, I made up a voice for a character in a picture (yeah, maybe weird, but whatever).  I'm not an expert at hypnosis, but I know enough to get in a decent trance.  Anyway, looking at the picture, I became entranced by consciously thinking this character was speaking to me with the voice I attributed to her.

I experimented with this self hypnosis further outside a hypnotic session and an entranced state.  In one instance, I wrote on a dry erase board, but imagined her saying beforehand ""Need help writing neatly?""  Oddly, my head nodded almost automatically in response.  Then, I'd have her say something like ""okay, ready go""  Right afterwards, and with several other tries, I wrote almost on auto pilot neater than usual .  I tried a random suggestion, saying a line 10 times fast, having my voice be louder each time.  I blurted it out easily without thinking.

I'm wondering for those who've been hypnotized, whether from a video, other person, etc.,  whether they've tried this (thinking of the voice to help perform tasks, or maybe help motivate oneself to work, to laugh to relieve stress, etc).  Are there potential ill effects of doing this for various tasks through out the day?  I read it's advisable to only have 2 hypnotic sessions a day, with at least an hour in between, but couldn't find anything about just doing quick tasks outside of trance.  When she's giving suggestions, from time to time,  I have her say it's a pressure-free choice to hear them to help prevent creating a dependency or addiction, but not sure if either would be likely.  Also, would doing this too much make you're mind too open to suggestions generally speaking?

I mentioned a lot there, but just trying to find out whether doing this at all is a bad idea.  It seems okay, but would like to be more sure if possible.  Any insight would be appreciated.

In one instance, I wrote on a dry erase board, but imagined her saying beforehand &amp;quot;Need help writing neatly?&amp;quot;  Oddly, my head nodded almost automatically in response.  Then, I&amp;#39;d have her say something like &amp;quot;okay, ready go&amp;quot;  Right afterwards, and with several other tries, I wrote almost on auto pilot neater than usual .  I tried a random suggestion, saying a line 10 times fast, having my voice be louder each time.  I blurted it out easily without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering for those who&amp;#39;ve been hypnotized, whether from a video, other person, etc.,  whether they&amp;#39;ve tried this (thinking of the voice to help perform tasks, or maybe help motivate oneself to work, to laugh to relieve stress, etc).  Are there potential ill effects of doing this for various tasks through out the day?  I read it&amp;#39;s advisable to only have 2 hypnotic sessions a day, with at least an hour in between, but couldn&amp;#39;t find anything about just doing quick tasks outside of trance.  When she&amp;#39;s giving suggestions, from time to time,  I have her say it&amp;#39;s a pressure-free choice to hear them to help prevent creating a dependency or addiction, but not sure if either would be likely.  Also, would doing this too much make you&amp;#39;re mind too open to suggestions generally speaking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned a lot there, but just trying to find out whether doing this at all is a bad idea.  It seems okay, but would like to be more sure if possible.  Any insight would be appreciated.  Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

The whole thing has me wondering what, if any, effect hypnosis might have on menopause and the related symptoms? Whether natural or surgical.

How much is 100 percent hormonal and how much can be effected mentally/by the unconscious mind?

For instance, it's known and proven that anesthesia can be hypnotically produced, but can, for instance, hot flashes be stopped or reduced?

,hypnosis,"Apologies in advance as this is going to be pretty long.  I don’t have any explanation for these events and it has bothered me for the last 4 years.

Background: At the time, I was in an abusive relationship. He was a real pos and constantly gaslit me, as well as other emotional/psychological abuse.

,hypnosis,"I just wanted to share my success story with drastically reducing my motion sickness through hypnosis -

Due to a rise in IBS and anxiety, I started experiencing motion sickness for the first time in my life. It wasn’t just on long journey drives but also experienced it going 2 minutes down the road. I felt devastated because it meant it was now a struggle to visit friends in different cities, go travelling and be able to do daily tasks like go  to the supermarket and work. I was also hoping to get my drivers license but this sickness suddenly made that seem impossible.

After one particular nasty experience where I was almost sick on a 10 minute drive, I realised that my only options were to medicate every time or try hypnosis. Despite my skepticism, I thought what the hell, I’ll give hypnosis a go.

And I’ve never looked back.

My hypnotherapist was awesome and we worked together to retrain my mind into thinking that my response wasn’t justified and that I will remain calm and in control on the journey. We figured out that a lot of it was down to my anxiety and my already predetermined mindset before even sitting in the car. We looked into my past experiences and feeling trapped in the car while feeling sick. She taught me the very valuable tool of meditation and mindfulness, deep breathing and pressure points. Honestly it was incredible what the mind can do.

It took a month to notice small changes in my reaction to motion, and it took 3 months before I went on my first long distance trip in almost a year. I felt really ok during it. I managed to reduce my anxiety, and as a result my motion sickness so much so that I was able to sit my license and pass. I can now comfortably drive around the city, pop down the road whenever, go visit friends in different cities and can finally do a bit of local travelling. I still take a mild anti-motion sickness med for long distance drives but can happily go from one side of the city to the other without prep. I have no doubt that over time I won’t even need these meds for long distance drives. I’ve also been able to use these techniques to reduce the daily nausea caused by my ibs anxiety.

&lt;p&gt;My hypnotherapist was awesome and we worked together to retrain my mind into thinking that my response wasn’t justified and that I will remain calm and in control on the journey. We figured out that a lot of it was down to my anxiety and my already predetermined mindset before even sitting in the car. We looked into my past experiences and feeling trapped in the car while feeling sick. She taught me the very valuable tool of meditation and mindfulness, deep breathing and pressure points. Honestly it was incredible what the mind can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a month to notice small changes in my reaction to motion, and it took 3 months before I went on my first long distance trip in almost a year. I felt really ok during it. I managed to reduce my anxiety, and as a result my motion sickness so much so that I was able to sit my license and pass. I can now comfortably drive around the city, pop down the road whenever, go visit friends in different cities and can finally do a bit of local travelling. I still take a mild anti-motion sickness med for long distance drives but can happily go from one side of the city to the other without prep. I have no doubt that over time I won’t even need these meds for long distance drives. I’ve also been able to use these techniques to reduce the daily nausea caused by my ibs anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this and you’re humming and harring about hypnosis - do it!! I was so incredibly defeated and skeptical and this has given me a new lease at life.&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"I've (37M) been interested in hypnosis and the subconscious mind for about 20 years. When I was young (and poor), I wasn't able to fully commit to working regularly with a certified hypnotist, until after I had graduated from college. I had met with several hypnotherapists but had never felt or received confirmation that it was having any effect on me. I had become pretty discouraged and took a break from hypnosis in general for many years. 

In July of 2020, during a dark time in my life, I had stumbled across the TED talk video below, and it blew my mind. It was the first time in my life where I had finally experienced proof that hypnosis can work on me. I quickly became a believer. 

It may have also been a sign from the universe because I later found out that the gentleman in the video has an office literally 15 minutes from my home. I've been seeing him every two weeks since November, and it's had a profound impact on my life. I'm a different person than I was two months ago. 

I'm excited to continue my journey and am just getting started. The video below is not to promote the person/practitioner, but rather to give hope to those that don't believe that it can work for them.

I have great control over my diet, mood, automatic and unconscious thoughts and I am learning about my mind every day. Following are the key books (not all) that I have learned from:-

1. Self mastery through conscious auto suggestions.
2. A guide to rational living by Dr. Albert Ellis
3. Thought Forms by Anne Besant
4. Practical guide to self hypnosis by Melvin Powers 
5. Creative visualisation by Shakti Gawain

I truly understand the importance of unconscious auto suggestions we give ourselves and all the kind of negative self talk that we indulge in needs to be reduced....

I am trying to achieve great depths in state of hypnosis and reach deeper and deeper in my somnambulistic states.

Following are the few books I have shortlisted but I have money to spend on just one book only at the moment :-

1. Hypnotherapy by David Elman
2. Instant Self hypnosis with eyes open. Forbes Robbins Blair
3. Hypnos and Hypnotherapy: Basic to Advanced for professionals by Calvin and Gerald.

Kelley Cutler was deeply skeptical when she took part in a monthlong pilot test of Reveri Health, a new digital hypnosis program, at Stanford University last year. The San Francisco social worker needed help quitting smoking, and only joined the program at her doctor’s urging.

“I was thinking it was nonsense and was never going to work,” says Ms. Cutler, 44, who had smoked for 25 years. Her first hypnosis session, which took place in person with a clinician, was so anxiety-producing that she had to have a cigarette afterward.

Reveri Health, one of a new generation of hypnosis programs and apps that make the practice easily accessible at home, then required her to take part in interactive, self-hypnosis sessions at home for a month. After two of the digital sessions, she was shocked to discover that she no longer felt like smoking. “The craving was really gone,” she says. “I can’t explain it. It doesn’t make sense.”

She hasn’t had a cigarette since. “This hypnosis is some crazy-ass voodoo,” she says. “And I mean that in a good way.”

Hypnosis is no longer considered crazy in the medical field, doctors say, but many patients, like Ms. Cutler, still are leery. The practice has increasingly gained acceptance in the medical community, and in the last two years, the research into how and why it works has accelerated, with new studies on the use of hypnosis to alleviate anxiety; ward off pain; and successfully inhibit the fear circuitry structures in the brain.

Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors have started to take notice, creating new apps that aim to popularize hypnosis in a similar way to meditation, which until recently was also considered fringe. A safer alternative to medications like opioids, hypnosis can be a helpful tool for combating the stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic, doctors and researchers say, especially as it can be done successfully via recording or over Zoom. But while many people are in need of stress relief right now, hypnosis still has a strong stigma that often prevents them from trying it.

“People either think it’s ridiculous or dangerous,” says David Spiegel, a clinical psychiatrist and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine and co-founder of Reveri Health. “Because it’s hypnosis, people just don’t take it seriously.”

Reveri Health, which is free and can be accessed through Amazon Alexa, launched in August and has about 2,200 users, Dr. Spiegel says. Mindset Health, a hypnotherapy startup, received $1.1 million in venture funding a year ago, says Alex Naoumidis, its co-founder and CEO. The company’s two hypnosis apps, Mindset and Nerva, have a total of roughly 6,200 paying users, Mr. Naoumidis says.

Hypnosis is the practice of easing a person into a relaxed, highly focused state that makes them unusually susceptible to suggestion, typically through verbal cues and mental imagery. Today it is used to help treat pain and conditions such as anxiety, phobias and sleep disorders, and to help stop behaviors like smoking or overeating. Much like meditation, hypnosis is a predominantly auditory therapy that works as well over Zoom as it does in person, says Cynthia Sholes, a neuroscientist and CEO of the Mind Wave Institute in Menlo Park, Calif. It may even work better at home, Dr. Sholes says, because people are more comfortable in their home environment with less novelty to distract their attention.

Reveri Health works on Alexa by using natural language processing, which decodes incoming sounds and matches them to pre-prepared instructions or responses. The program asks questions like “Where are you feeling stress right now?” and responds to the answers accordingly, then asks the user to participate in a series of breathing and imagery exercises. (“Picture that you’re surfing waves of uncertainty.”)

In recent years, new research has led to a greater understanding of how hypnosis works. Four years ago, brain imaging published in the journal Cerebral Cortex suggested that the hypnotic state reduces activity in the parts of the brain involved in critical judgment and analysis, allowing a therapist to reach areas of the brain that are more open to suggestion.

Or as California hypnotherapist and coach Linda Shively explains it, “hypnosis gets the conscious mind out of the way.” That way, she adds, “change can happen quickly, relatively painlessly and effectively.”

Earlier this year, a study Dr. Spiegel co-authored in Cerebral Cortex found that hypnosis mobilizes neurochemicals in the brain that enable a person to self-soothe, a process he likened to “helping people to use their own internal pharmacy.”

Hypnosis doesn’t work for everybody. About one-third of the population isn’t susceptible to hypnosis, according to Dr. Spiegel. The practice also isn’t well-regulated. And while the amount of research on hypnosis has surged in recent years, large areas remain to be studied, which researchers say has caused some professionals to avoid it.

Joseph Green, psychology professor at Ohio State University, says there is strong empirical support for the use of hypnosis in pain control, but while there are indications that it helps treat other conditions as well, it is difficult for researchers to isolate the specific effects of hypnosis because it is so often used in tandem with other therapies.

But the biggest obstacle to the large-scale adoption of hypnosis remains its stigma. Hypnosis is still known in many quarters as a stage stunt rather than a therapeutic tool. “You know, the guy with the watch—the swirling thing—that puts you into a deep, deep sleep and then you act like a chicken,” says Mark Wise, a hypnotherapist in Santa Cruz, Calif., who has worked with individual athletes and college teams. He said that persistent stereotype still prevents many people from trying hypnosis.

Those who have experienced hypnosis, however, say it can be very helpful, especially during the pandemic. Dr. Sholes says hypnosis—conducted over Zoom—has brought relief to her patients who feel stuck, burned out, and more vulnerable to compulsive behavior due to the pandemic. “We have wine more often, comfort foods,” says Dr. Sholes, who combines hypnosis with other therapeutic techniques. “We binge on Netflix.”

When the pandemic forced Debi Corrie—a self-described “emotional eater”—to isolate at her home in Maryville, Ill., she gained 10 pounds. She wanted something quicker than therapy to help, so she decided to try hypnotherapy despite her skepticism. “I have always been traditional medicine, and this isn’t traditional to me,” says Ms. Corrie, 58, owner of a financial services business. But since starting hypnotherapy over Zoom in October, she says she’s lost more than 7 pounds and stopped binge eating. “I don’t understand the science,” she says. “But it has been mind-blowing. A game changer.”

I have some question and know it might be a lot but i wanted to ask and did not see lot of answer. So it is a long post

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My first question is, to what extend can i change my personality? Like playing a character. It could be fun to try and give a better act as comedian X). 

Can you read while being in trance and what would it brings more than a normal reading?
Comprehension, recall, speed etc.

Is it possible to do selfhypnosis and making cold and hot reading subconsciously after knowing what you have to look for?
Speeding up the learning process by making subconsciously what you learned (skip the conscious part)

Can you do some anchor to obtain an absoulute ear/synesthesia?
Can you use selfhypnosis to boost your mental visulaisation? (being able to make mentally an experiment like Tesla or projecting in reality a mental image as if it was on paper or so?).

I really want to discover the exrend and power of it but it is currently hard as i struggle with self hypnosis and dont know anybody i could try with. And therapist are expensive as i dont want to fixe an issues though.

,hypnosis,"Hi redditors!

Here I share my self-hypnosis practice. This is a long post. For those who don’t have time to read all of it, you can just read the four step process in bold below and provide your comments based on that. For everyone else, please read on.

I’ve been using hypnosis regularly for a few months now and I haven’t noticed any results. So far I am not very successful and I am not sure why. I think my problem could be my change-work / auto-suggestions. Anyways, below is my practice. Please review. I look forward to hearing from you in the comment section!

Before I get started, here is some background and a few notes on my main purpose for doing hypnosis, which is to eliminate procrastination. My problem that I am trying to solve is that I only study to become a professional web developer and practice to become a public speaker once a week on one of my days off from work. I am trying to be better disciplined by using hypnosis to convince myself to be productive 1-2 hours *every day* towards my career goals.  I’m trying to make studying part of my daily routine by convincing myself that it is more desirable, rewarding and refreshing than wandering reddit / Drudgereport / CNN. You will see this reflected in Step #3 below (Change work, my auto suggestions).



**BEGIN** 

**Step #1 INDUCTION (5 mins)**:

* Turn on binaural beats (6-7hz)

* Play raining ambient noise.

* Meditate doing “[BreathWork](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxcare.breathwork&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US)” &gt; &gt;  One breathwork cycle involves taking a deep belly breath in through my nose for a count of 4 seconds, hold my breath for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds.  I do sixteen of those reps which takes a total of about 5 minutes altogether. It’s relaxing and helps put me deeper into trance. 

**Step #2. DAYDREAM** while listening to two of these five songs (~8mins total):

 * Econoline Crush’s “[Sycophant](https://youtu.be/PVeiFF7IaSQ)”

 * AC DC’s “[Thunderstruck](https://youtu.be/v2AC41dglnM)”

 * Sophie Lloyd’s “[After Insanity](https://youtu.be/IXTa0nzplx0)”

 * A Perfect Cricle’s “[The Hollow](https://youtu.be/avgiqNapUx0)”

 * Ariana Grand’s “[Dangerous Woman](https://youtu.be/TFrMDGfW_Sg)”

For each hypnosis session, I choose two at random - - I don’t do all of them every session. For more information about how I daydream, I have elaborated below.

**Step #3. CHANGEWORK SUGGESTIONS** (I read these twice, once with my earphones removed and once with earphones on) (2mins total):

* “I shall fall asleep as soon as my head makes contact with the pillow.”

* “When my funky computer alarm rings at 6:30pm (*cue*) on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday, that shall *trigger* a strong, loud *craving* and desire to first turn off my computer monitor and then jump into an easy Toastmasters prep session in my kitchen to express myself  and reaffirm who I really am over and over. Then I shall follow that up with a coding session playing around with my Python interpreter and debugger at my computer in my VSC development environment. Altogether at the end I shall feel overwhelmingly and wonderfully *satisfied*, *refreshed*, and *rewarded*!” 

**Step #4. INDUCTION COOL DOWN** (5 mins):

* Play raining ambient noise while doing Breathwork - 16 more deep belly breaths.

**END**



So that’s it! Above are the general contours of my concerted practice in hypnosis. Based on what you see above, what would you people advise to help improve my process?

For those of you who like to read and have time on your hands, what follows are some more considerations about Steps #2 and #3. Also included below are notes about why I am using hypnosis for self-discipline in the first place and other strategies I’ve used to overcome my procrastination.

For Step #2 (Daydreaming), while listening to one of those music tracks, I visualize a ball of light, like the sun of our solar system, with solar flares extending outwards. As an act of personal creation, I add smaller spheres of light in orbit with sparks emanating around the sun, bouncing and dancing dramatically in alignment with the music (bass and drums). For other songs, instead of the sun, I visualize a motorcyclist running red lights weaving in and out of traffic up and down busy city streets with camera views from impossible angles with  “bullet time” (slow motion effect - - like from the original Matrix movie). While doing that kind of visualization, I listen to these music tunes as catalysts at medium volume. It feels great. I achieve total transcendence.

For Step #3 (Changework), I know what some of you are already thinking. You are going to say: “You’re overthinking it. You are trying to force change.” Instead of reading aloud that paragraph in full, I have condensed it down to this:

 * I will fall asleep as soon as my head makes contact with pillow

 * I will have 5:00am start every morning

 * I will do +2 hours of Python every day 

Do you think this is much more concise and easier to suggest? I find that both - - the one in long format or the one in bullet point format, neither works.

As part of my effort to improve my self discipline, I’ve read *Atomic* *Habits* by the famed James Clear who provides all kinds of insight into improving self discipline. There is actually quite a bit of overlap between James Clear’s instruction manual for building effective habits and hypnosis. So I’m trying to combine James Clear’s advice with my current hypnosis practice. 

James Clear explains how to build effective habits in this way:

[General Cue-Craving-Response-Reward](https://imgur.com/0n7KjsI.jpg)

Here is my application of the above to my particular situation with hypnosis:

[Specific Cue-Craving-Response-Reward](https://i.imgur.com/AwN0b6i.jpg)

This is exactly the habit that I am trying to create and I figure hypnosis can enhance this effort.

My problem is that the cue doesn’t work. I have no craving, I don’t respond well. After a successful multi-hour coding session on my day off, I do feel rewarded and refreshed, but achieving that end goal is hard to recall / anticipate / integrate / experience on all the other days of the week. I need to experience feelings of being rewarded / satisfied every day but the emotion just isn’t strong enough. It’s a weak signal. I was hoping that hypnosis could help magnify and make those feelings stronger. But I can’t figure out how to do that.

,hypnosis,"I have been practicing hypnosis with my girlfriend for about a year. She's been a wonderful guinea pig as I have been learning to put all of my book knowledge into practice, but she's been my only subject. I get to practice and she gets to zone out on mental vacation for a bit. I haven't yet had the opportunity or confidence to take it any further.

During a trance I will normally ask how she's doing at points as a check-in. Make sure she's feeling OK, is comfortable, doesn't have to pee, stuff like that. In one of our sessions I had suggested that when I ask ""How are you feeling?"" she would respond, ""Deeply Hypnotized"". I didn't think I heavily reinforced this. We used it a few times throughout the session and that was it. While I try to be careful and set firm limits on any suggestions (when/where/why/who) I didn't this time. When I brought her up I asked how she was feeling and she responded normally and didn't have any conscious recollection of the event. I didn't think much more of it.

The next time she was in trance, at least a week (maybe 2) later, it started out normal, I'd ask how she was feeling and she'd respond, ""Ok"" or ""relaxed"", something along those lines. I continued to deepen her and then it happened, she responded with. ""I'm very relaxed..... deeply hypnotized"". It caught me off guard. I tested a few more times throughout the session and each response was ""deeply hypnotized"". 

I understand that I could have stopped it there and just reset her expectations of how to respond to that query... but my curiosity has gotten the better of me. I now use it as a gauge of how far in she is depending on her response.  The only other trigger I've attempt to plant is her ""sleep"" trigger and that required deliberate action, anchoring, repetition.

I guess I want to better understand the organic nature of, what feels like, a conditioned response and how it selectively manifests depending on her perceived level of trance. If anyone has thoughts or can point me in the right direction for further reading I'd very much appreciate it.

,hypnosis,"Back in October I discovered theta 8hz brainwave binaural audio tracks on YouTube. One channel in particular called The Astral Circle has a very popular video titled “[Enter The Astral Realm | 432 Hz Deep Lucid Dreaming Sleep Music | 8 Hz Binaural Beat Brainwaves](https://youtu.be/HA2LTXOUMzM)” 
The very first time that I listened to that video was for about 40 minutes before bed. Although I didn’t enter a lucid dream state  and I certainly didn’t “astral project”, but when I woke up the next morning, I could tell that I had a very, very deep sleep. My dreams were more vivid and real. So it worked! Then a few days later I tried again with a similar length of time before bed, and the impact was half as much.

I began regulating my meditation breathing practice by using a terrific Android app called [BreathWork](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxcare.breathwork&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US ). One breathwork cycle involves taking a deep belly breath in through my nose for a count of 4 seconds, hold my breath for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds.  I do sixteen of those reps which takes a total of about 5 minutes altogether. It’s relaxing and helps put me deeper into trance. The first time that I combined binaural beats with breathwork, my induction was deep. I could really feel it. But the next time when I did the same technique, the impact was less than the first. And then the third time was even less than that.

Now when I listen to binaural audio tracks and meditate, I feel almost nothing. I even tried listening to that binaural YT video for 2  full hours before bed. The next morning, my dreams were shallow and my sleep was nothing special - - nothing particular deep about it at all.

*Here are my pointed non-rhetorical questions for all of you*:

**#1.** Is this phenomenon of degraded effectiveness common to other people who use binaural beats to enter trance?

**#2.** Is this phenomenon I describe of reduced effectiveness perhaps a demonstration of how the human mind works in general, similar to when people abuse drugs, like to get the same desired effect, you need to go harder and longer every time? Am I building a tolerance to binaural audio tracks? Is that possible?

**#3.** Is there a way to measure how deep into a trance I am without an EEG machine or having to shell out hundreds of dollars for those lame, gimmicky  “bio sensing headbands” [like this one on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Flowtime-Biosensing-Meditation-Brainwave-Mindfulness/dp/B0824L385C/)? 

**#4.** I can’t expect the precision of a true EEG machine in a doctor’s office, but is there a way for someone like me doing self-hypnosis to get a general sense by intuition or some mind trick as to roughly how deep I am into trance?

**#5.**  I really, really don’t want to spend $200 on a headband, but if I did go ahead and commit to that kind of purchase, what could I expect in terms of effectiveness? Could any one of you people here share your experience with these basic, off-the-shelf bio-sensing machines? Are they what they claim to be?

,hypnosis,"Sorry for my bad english, not by my honesty.

Its was in june 2016, alone. How ? Perhaps like that ...

First, you must ""understand"" (pretend) you are NOTHING and have nothing.

Your ""me"" is really nothing, your reality too.

That's why you must be hypnotized.

So when you will lose yourself, you will not lose anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, you must too ""understand"" (pretend) that the truth is ZERO, and that world empty.

You are totally powerless in a pointless world , so why do you care about reality ?

If you don't accept the first and second point, I think your conscience will refuse the future new reality from your desire.

Because you are not here for the truth and the reality, but for the POWER.

The power to be strong (not more smart) and good in your head.

Don't forget you are always alone in your head, no matter you think.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, look someone you like on a screen you like (actor, singer, etc).

You must say and repeat ""I am him / her"" all the time, say it loud, repeat in your mind.

It's not true, but you want POWER, you want to be strong in your head.

And the truth don't give you what you want et need.

That's why we watch movies : we don't want the reality.

&amp;#x200B;

In june 2016,  I had become the person I was watching on the screen.

I was shaking very hard, my heart was beating much faster, but my head was doing me good.

I can swear it was a great feeling to feel like you had become the person on the screen.  The following year my father died and it was a shock that made me stop the experience.  I intend to resume the experience soon and ""become"" what I watch.

,hypnosis,"Hey there all. I feel a little rusty on my hypnosis muscles since this quarantine, while I haven’t had much session time I’ve done a lot of learning so I have a lot of concepts I want to get some reps in on! 

If anyone out there is interested in being hypnotized/having mild hypnotherapy done I’d be willing to run some sessions free of cost..

And if any hypnotists want to take turns practicing on each other I’m happy to do that too! 

This would take place ideally over zoom with audio or audio/visual.

Let me know if you’re interested :)


Edit: there’s been so much interest I think we’re going to set up a group to hopefully get a rotation of partners/days going so we can all get practice and exposure with different styles and personalities. If you’re interested feel free to comment or send me a PM! Looking very forward to meeting everyone.



UPDATE:
Due to the high high high demand, I created a subreddit for those who are interested to get in touch with people who can provide either hypnotism or a receptive mind. In an ideal world I'd love to work with everyone interested but we've been blessed with SO many people showing interest that I simply don't have the time to run sessions with every person. That being said, I'll work with as many people personally as I can...so feel free to join our new subreddit with lots of talented hypnotists and willing subjects or message me directly! :)

One of the hypnotists on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/hypnosis/), about maybe a year ago, expressed the idea that pretty much everyone can hallucinate but that different subjects would have a different level of resistance to it. We put it aside as a hypothesis and now we can likely comment. While the resistance is indeed a factor, it looks like we've experimentally confirmed (N-of-1) the value of other factors. Let's make a list

* Openness to the experience, related to belief, faith, consensus, to resolution or suspension of inner conflict / resistance, to the *network* effect which corellates with the size of corpus callosum (“evidence from the Big Five shows that L are significantly more agreeable, by exhibiting higher preferences for cooperation, and also tend to be more extraverted, by being more sociable”; “AGR is significantly higher for L (25-48% s.d.)”; “EXT is higher for L (4-34% s.d.)”, “OPE is higher for L (8-32% s.d.)”). Might also be affected by cannabis and various downers

* The skill of producing/generating/rendering a visual experience. There's often a coherent art style

* Access to visual memories: some hallucinations are reproductions of the past. Likely correlates with the right hemisphere activation (which specializes in episodic memory and which is often embodied)

* The skill in mixing the two, and drawing on memory in generating new content

* The skill of placing the generated content into (proprioceptive and visual) space

* The skill of reusing and/or reinterpreting the existing visual input

* The skill of focusing on the new visuals, activating the contributing processes and pathways, guiding the experience, selectively inhibiting the existing visual input in order to reduce the interference

* The ability to power the necessary processes. Might be affected by serotonin and various uppers

(p.s. One controlversial idea embedded here is that there is no hallucinatory drugs per se, but that some drugs are good at stimulating/powering certain areas and processes, others are good at inhibiting or scrambling, and others are good at strengthening the placebo effect; and I'm talking here only about visual hallucinations, not the delirium ones)

,hypnosis,"I  recently tried a sort of self-hypnosis. I had a problem of  sleeplessness for nearly a decade. I decided to use simple self-hypnosis  exercise -- while sleeping (or trying to sleep) i kept repeating myself  ""I am feeling very sleepy"" many times until i sleep. My subconscious  slowly got programmed for this and now it is a lot easier for me even to  sleep in short period. This has been a big achievement for me  personally.

Hypnosis always fascinated me and i think it is amazing to reprogram one's mind.

Though,  I am mainly curious about emotional behavioral aspects of Hypnosis (I'd  love to explore books or materials related to this if anyone can  suggest). Often people learn wrong things from their past experience and  that becomes the core part of their behavior which sometime even they  don't like. Common examples like negative thinking, hating others too  much, wrong food habbits or even nail biting, and so on. Hypnosis can do  wonder in making changes in such cases. This is most fascinating for  me. So based on this i have few questions.

1. I  know nothing is guaranteed in hypnosis and mostly changes including  permanent or temporary changes depend on an individual. However, How  easy or difficult would it be for a person to change the way they think?  For example, if i hypnotize a person (who is generally negative about  all things in his life) and give suggestion like ""You like to only think  positively now onward"" or ""You don't like to think negatively"" how well  this would work? In other words, can that suggestions, if reinforced  multiple time, make permanent changes in one's life?
2. Same  for anger response or short tempered people. What if i gave them  suggestion like ""Whenever you feel like being angry you'll find it  difficult to become angry"" or ""Anger is an Evil and you really love  being calm in any adverse situation"" would these suggestion change them?
3. Can  hypnosis be addictive through suggestion? For example what if a  hypnotherapist create triggers like ""Every night at 9 o'clock, you'll  desperately like to go into hypnosis"" or ""Every time you hear the word  XYZ, You'd wish to go into hypnosis"" or even ""Everytime you see me  scratching my head, you'd desperately wish to go into trance again"".  We'd want to assume here that Hypnotherapist was successful enough to  put subject in Somnambulistic Trance while giving suggestion first time.
4. I  understand that a realistic suggestion and personal's willingness to  change both heavily affect the final result. However can't second one be  controlled through suggestion? For example, a person who never had  intention to do Yoga everyday and goes to Hypnotherapist. What if the  Hypnotherapist suggests ""Now Doing Yoga everyday is one of your most  important priority"". Wouldn't that make the person ""feel like"" doing  yoga then after atleast until suggestion wear off?
5. If  i am not a good hypnotist but i keep repeating myself ""I am a very  great and experienced Hypnotist who can easily hypnotize the subject"".  Would that change my body language in such a way that it becomes easier  to Hypnotize the subject (Obviously all other factor still matter a lot  such as pretalk, Induction etc but it is confidence that isn't always  easy to achieve.)",t2_5ikxt7ms,False,,0,False,Emotional Behavior Aspects of Hypnosis?,[],r/hypnosis,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jysjzb,False,dark,0.94,,public,12,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,12,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606063647.0,text,6,,,text,self.hypnosis,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I  recently tried a sort of self-hypnosis.

,hypnosis,"I’ll start off by saying I simply cannot afford the high costs of hypnosis or any form of therapy - especially here I live in California. I’ve been unemployed and on rent deferment due to the pandemic since March. Even hypnotists dong sessions over Skype are charging $100-150 per 1 hour session. That’s 2 weeks of groceries for me! And they can never tell you how many sessions you will likely need. I’m laying this out first because I know there are those who will respond with something like “how much is your life worth to you?” or “you get what you pay for” which is NOT helpful, kinda manipulative and stinks of privilege. 

So with that out of the way, I’m reaching out to this group to ask about free or affordable online resources. Can any of you please recommend any particular YouTube videos / series, audio books, or other online resources for hypnosis. I’m willing to pay a reasonable fee for a paid program. I just can’t afford a real hypnotist at this time. Thanks.

EDIT: Someone suggested I explain why it looking for hypnosis in the first place so here it goes... I have unresolved adult ADD, depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I can’t seem to focus or plan my life or hold down a job long term (before Covid). I went to a top 20 university but 20 years later my life is nowhere near my classmate’s.

On top of that I react badly to ALL pharmaceuticals.

,hypnosis,"I had my first hypnotherapy session earlier this week. I don't think it went well.

I've been struggling with math anxiety for decades. I'd like to resolve them, and I believe hypnotherapy is for me.  
The therapist tried to get me to imagine the thing that gets me upset about math, but when I visualized the math problems, I felt nothing. To help her out, I discussed something else that had upset me earlier that morning, that might bring those feelings out. But it wasn't math related. That worked. I felt the same physical responses to my math anxiety.  


She then had me visualize myself in front of a movie screen. She had me view the event on the screen. She then had me view an event in which I was relaxed. Then she had me view an event where I'm relaxed/happy that occurred after the event that got me upset.  


That's when things started to fall apart. I told her that was kind of hard to do, as the upsetting event was maybe an hour prior. She struggled with the session there, so I helped her out by remembering something else from my past that was a relaxing/happy moment.  


Then she had me ""separate"" from myself in the theater. I was supposed to view myself from the control room. This was difficult to do, as I chose to sit near the back of the imaginary theater. But I tried. She then wanted me to visualize myself watching myself watch the scenes play out on the screen. She instructed me to raise my hand, when I see myself raise my hand, to signal when the scenes finished playing out.  


I watched myself, but then I wondered: ""Am I controlling the *me* that I'm viewing? Or is *he* controlling his arm?"" I was confused. Who's controlling his arm? Then, my visualization ended. I told her I ""lost it"". She asked what I meant. I explained that I no longer saw myself. She asked why not.  


I explained that I didn't understand her instruction. Who's raising my hand? She counted me out of the session, which I never *felt* was in. We discussed what had happened. She explained that my inner voice is in the way. I asked how that could be, that the inner voice *is* me.  


She explained that it's not. The discussion continued, and is beyond the scope of this post.  


If asked I can go into more detail. I'm going for a second session next week. Due to the cost, I'm probably not going anymore.

i have seen that arm catalepsy is possible for exemple, exerting great force even when other ppl try to move the arm etc. 

So my question is :

Is it possible to use hypnosis to increase performance like strength ??
(holding longer the horsestance or lifting heavier load for exemple )

If so how would you proceed?
If not, why is it not possible?

 EDIT : Here i say enhance performance but i dont say breaking all the limiter.

For exemple the max strength of a newbee is 30% of his total potential, the max of a trained person is usualy around 60%. 
The question was not for the newbee to go from 30% to 60% or 100% in one shot but to go from 30% to 35% or 40% in one shot.

I have not been able to sleep so far (and it is now 7 am where I am), and I am getting very worried. And this is what happened.

During the day, I attempted, for the first time, hypnosis with a Youtube video of guided hypnosis. I did it more or less out of curiosity. I closed my eyes. When the therapist in the video counted down from 5 to 1, my eye lids were being tightly shut - I would describe the sensation of being squeezed. And the eye lids were twitching. It could have been rapid eye movement. I don't know. It felt as if I need to really shut my eyes very tight in order to ""SEE"". Then I felt pins and needles on my scalp. And everything became really dark.  I believe that got into a hypnotic state. However, I felt that I was not ready, and therefore, I opened my eyes, and did not complete the process. Then I began to cry. The rest of my day felt a little strange. 

When I went to bed at night, things felt instantly different when I closed my eyes. I began to see what I would call ""energy bands"" floating and flying across my ""eyes"". When I tried to see those ""energy bands"", The same thing with my eye lids happened - the involuntary tight squeezing the twitching. My heart was pounding, and I freaked out. I opened my eyes. Then I tried to sleep again, but the same thing happened for several times. I was drenched in sweat. 

The last time this happened, I tried to persist and see how things would end, and then my nose was being involuntarily ""squinted"" upwards and twitching wildly, in addition to my eye lids being very tightly squeezed and twitching.

,hypnosis," Hi Reddit!

Today I'm here to chat a bit about:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Michael Sealey, and some of his advanced techniques to achieve results using audio hypnosis. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Dr Richard Bandler (co-founder of NLP) and his work including the book Tranceformaton.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know Michael. I’m not here to promote anything. 

I’m a fan of his free YouTube content. So are about 1.4m other people.

I also don’t know Richard, but I admire both of them deeply.

I use self hypnosis often. I wrote this in the hopeful spirit that other Redditors would want to discuss some of these things with me. I’ve never had a friend that I talked to about any of this stuff before. I have only studied on my own, and don’t have any kind of professional training in hypnosis whatsoever. 

In Hypnosis to Stop Procrastination (Overcome Anxiety, Perfectionism &amp; Stop Procrastinating):

[https://youtu.be/HG1HvKkHE8s](https://youtu.be/HG1HvKkHE8s)

Michael uses a series of gentle, soothing, mildly confusing embedded loops. 

When the subconscious mind gets slammed with too many things to keep track of, it helps bypass and subdue the critical factor, as we know. I’ve had some success with creating my own personal inductions that utilize mild confusion. These have been very basic, and not much different than re-worded versions of Bandler’s examples, such as stacking questions.

Like “Can you relax your left ear and your right knee at the same time? What about your left knee and one nostril? Can you relax both the back and front of you at the same time? See, it doesn’t matter where we relax…the only thing that matters is that we relax…now” (which is given as a downwardly inflected command at the end of a series of pacing statements). 

The above audio by Michael is a great example for me to study, since it contains multiple uses of the Milton Model that Dr Bandler discusses in Tranceformation, including multiple points of reference. Michael easily switches 'referential index’ (proper term in the Milton Model) by going from the first to the second to the third person, i.e. “he said” … “and then I said”… “and after what she said to us, we” ... so that the listener quickly loses track of who is talking about what, and the effect is a gradual deepening of the trance state.

I keep feeling myself going through multiple, deepening levels of consciousness when listening to this one, without going completely under. I have completed it 4 or 5 times and have gotten so much stuff done. I can't even get into that, or this post will go on forever.

I’m able to pay attention to cues like my left eyelid fluttering or the classic trance sigh, which let me know when I’m going deeper mentally. I think it could be important to be familiar with the trance states yourself, and be able to put yourself in and out of trance easily, if you hope to help other people with hypnotherapy. I’m curious to know if other people agree with that.

This is the only recording of Michael’s that I have been able to stay awake to whilst listening. TBH, it’s the only one I have wanted to stay awake for. Heh. 

Michael uses many time-honored hypnotic techniques seamlessly. He’s a naturally gifted word-weaver. Trevor Silvestor, a retired police officer, wrote a pretty good book called WordWeaving™ I recently finished giving it a rough first read, but I would need to spend some serious time rereading it again before I would attempt to discuss it with confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like we're only beginning to discover what’s possible with the human mind, and that excites me. It's one reason why I’m such a huge fan of Dr Bandler.   


One of my favorite lines of his (roughly paraphrased) is “Ooh. So the doctors tell me that whenever a symptom goes away in a patient...it always \*has\* to reappear somewhere else! So I thought to myself, ""COOL! I’ll take this guy here, with his hysterical paralysis … and give him the best erections any man alive has ever had.” 

The man is a legend to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The roles of the conscious/subconscious mind are still a mystery. I’m not sure anyone truly understands their powers. 

Ok, back to nested loops. As we know, the listener will be in trance while receiving the embedded commands. The commands are given with intonation and inflections delivered during a series of simple story instructions. The stories themselves are unimportant. The formula for the loops is what is important. Ensuring that the proper formula is followed, and that rapport is gained and the delivery is smooth-these are things that matter. I wondered if anyone here has had experience creating nested loops in their own hypnotic inductions. 

With proper nested loops, the listener, according to Bandler, will be unable to recall any specific instructions given to them via the nested loops. Yet after the session ends, the listener will tend to carry out the instructions to the letter.

I have not attempted any nested loops yet. I find them fascinating and wonder why they are so effective.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a bit obsessed with Dr Richard Bandler and his book Tranceformation. I first became interested in NLP when I heard Tony Robbins talk about role modeling excellence, some 10 years ago. I’ve studied Richard’s books and the PDF files of his older books, including Frogs to Princes, and the Structure of Magic Volumes 1 and 2. I mainly have focused on his extensive book Tranceformation. He discusses each of the Milton model concepts in depth, and while the book does have some length to it, IMO it contains invaluable info that the shortened editions simply don’t have. (Such as Get the Life You Want)

If I didn’t take the time to keep rereading this one book, Tranceformation, by Richard Bandler, more than 3 times in its entirety, and not give up on it, over a period of time that spanned more than 5 years…I likely wouldn’t understand a thing about NLP. I think I did think “Fuck it! This shit is way too complicated for me to understand!” hundreds of times, right, but then I began doing positive affirmations. I recognized that I was basically ensuring my own failure by talking to myself that way. 

Dr Bandler got me hooked on NLP and hypnosis. NLP is a complex field, in my personal opinion. But he does simplify a lot of things such as the VAK fast phobia cure and many other therapies-too many to list here. Some of his personal philosophies that I love are that people need choices, and they always make the best one at the time. They just don't always know they have choices. Also, in his view, people need to enjoy life more, and the best thing about the past is that it's OVER.

Because of his fun, quirky, and pioneering attitude, I can’t get enough of him. I wish he had more videos of himself on YouTube. If anyone has links, I would appreciate them. I’ve only found a handful. I must contact him. Nice, see? That’s Michael Sealey’s anti-procrastination audio working its magic on me. Seriously. You just watched it in action.

Please discuss if you would like, and thank you for reading my post. I'm feeling brave enough to click POST now. Maybe it's not bravery. Maybe I just stopped procrastinating, thanks to Michael Sealey.

Kind regards

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit obsessed with Dr Richard Bandler and his book Tranceformation. I first became interested in NLP when I heard Tony Robbins talk about role modeling excellence, some 10 years ago. I’ve studied Richard’s books and the PDF files of his older books, including Frogs to Princes, and the Structure of Magic Volumes 1 and 2. I mainly have focused on his extensive book Tranceformation. He discusses each of the Milton model concepts in depth, and while the book does have some length to it, IMO it contains invaluable info that the shortened editions simply don’t have. (Such as Get the Life You Want)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I didn’t take the time to keep rereading this one book, Tranceformation, by Richard Bandler, more than 3 times in its entirety, and not give up on it, over a period of time that spanned more than 5 years…I likely wouldn’t understand a thing about NLP. I think I did think “Fuck it! This shit is way too complicated for me to understand!” hundreds of times, right, but then I began doing positive affirmations. I recognized that I was basically ensuring my own failure by talking to myself that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Bandler got me hooked on NLP and hypnosis. NLP is a complex field, in my personal opinion. But he does simplify a lot of things such as the VAK fast phobia cure and many other therapies-too many to list here. Some of his personal philosophies that I love are that people need choices, and they always make the best one at the time. They just don&amp;#39;t always know they have choices. Also, in his view, people need to enjoy life more, and the best thing about the past is that it&amp;#39;s OVER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of his fun, quirky, and pioneering attitude, I can’t get enough of him. I wish he had more videos of himself on YouTube. If anyone has links, I would appreciate them. I’ve only found a handful. I must contact him. Nice, see? That’s Michael Sealey’s anti-procrastination audio working its magic on me. Seriously. You just watched it in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please discuss if you would like, and thank you for reading my post. I&amp;#39;m feeling brave enough to click POST now. Maybe it&amp;#39;s not bravery. Maybe I just stopped procrastinating, thanks to Michael Sealey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind regards&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"I'm not an expert on hypnosis or psychology or any of it, but I have a big history of porn addiction. I'm 'clean' now, as I don't watch any porn, and I just focus on achieving goals and repairing myself. However the porn I watched was very powerful and from some cursory google searches it seems to affect a lot of men. It's called ""sissy hypno"" and it's about feminising yourself, in appearance and sexual role, to be like a woman, and to be sexually attracted to a penis. There would be flashing images and subliminal messages, some of them very well made.

At a young age I went through with realising these fantasies and came to learn that it wasn't a real attraction. The experiences were very negative and traumatic. Despite this, I kept watching the hypnosis which took over my life in a way, and kept convincing myself that it was a real part of me. In real life, I have no attraction to men, no suppressed desire, or any inclination of gay tendencies.

But now, after years and years of being addicted to this stuff, I struggle with sexual desire for women. This has caused me a lot of pain because I've been in relationships with partners I had strong emotional and romantic connections with but couldn't perform no matter how much I wanted to. My thinking is that if I wired myself this way, and that my sexuality was moulded and shaped, it should be able to change back. So shouldn't it be possible to hypnotise myself again but towards being attracted to women's bodies?

,hypnosis,"So I’m doing a Hypnosis study for my Psych class and we are supposed to conduct a theoretical experiment on participants. 

I’m curious on a few things 

1. What would you say is the best way to measure hypnotizability? Suggestibility measure or EEG tech or a post test from the subject/ hypnotist. I’ve done my own research but it’s hard to find a definitive awnser to this. 

2. My hypothesis is Trust is more influential then personality to hypnotizability. I’m having a hard time conceptualizing trust as a variable and then measuring it... I’ve found some literature and I’m thinking of separating it into (preconceived bias, openness to experience and interpersonal trust) interpersonal trust seems hard to measure for, unless I staged some sort of manipulation. 

I have two thoughts in mind 

A. I’m thinking of doing a pretest measuring for my dependent variables then measuring hypnotizability (via EEG or Suggestibility Measures) 

Or 
 
B. Same as A, but I separate the subjects into 4 groups and measure hypnotizability after subjecting them to specific manipulations aiming to see if a change to the hypnotist (dressing them less professionally) or Chang in the environment (comfy office vs lab setting) affects hypnotizability with the control group being a office with someone who is dressed professionally.

,hypnosis,"So here is how I did it. I don't know if this will work for other people. but its working for me.

1. Start reading. Read everything. If you're going to teach yourself then you have to know what your doing.  I'm going to specifically preference reading because the books and articles on hypnosis are typically better than youtube videos. That is, when you watch a hypnosis video, you're not going to see the failures, and you're typically going to see very successful successes. However, at the beginner stage, seeing someone do a flawless Elman induction with a very hypnotizable person isn't helpful. More realistically, the first person you worth with will get a PMR and deepeners, test, etc...

2. Practice self-hypnosis. ""But,"" you say, ""that doesn't interest me!"" That's fine.  There are a number of good reasons to do it though.  Firstly, it gives you an idea of what to expect if it works, and what to expect if it doesn't. It will make you a better hypnotist if you can convey these things to other people.  Secondly, it gives you an icebreaker when you're trying to get people to help you out by being participants.  If they know that you're 'into self-hypnosis to help with procrastination' then you have a natural in later. Talk about it, normalise it to the people around you.  When you've found someone who might be interested, man up and ask them to help you out. You don't have to frame it as hypnosis - just some fun game-type stuff to try some fun things out.

3. Watch hypnotists do their thing.  I don't mean James Tripp doing hypnosis without trance, or Jacquin Anthony. I mean people doing long inductions that have results at the end. For a lot of participants, being a good subject is a learnt skill. That means your wife or boyfriend or friend is unlikely to be able to manifest a lot of phenomena without a lot of groundwork.  At the least you're going to do an induction, a couple of deepeners, testing. What I've found helpful is finding a hypnotist with a LOT of videos that have good results, and then watching the inductions one after the other, making notes, figuring out the structure, figuring out the language patterns.

Cont... For example, I found one hypnotist who does three inductions in a row. He frames them differently - the first is directed at the suggestion to sleep, another at the suggestion of let the consciousness drift away. By doing it this way they segue nicely into each other. One is a visualization exercise, the next has an arm drop in it. They will both effect different people differently.

Cont... You'll know when you've done enough of this when you are basically able to do someone else's induction word for word. I'm not recommending wrote learning it, but rather, when you know it that well, you probably have reviewed it enough times to tease out all the minute but important things the tist is doing. For me it meant doing mind maps, bullet lists, etc.

4. Learn your pretalk. If you're going to hypnotize someone then you need to build rapport. You also need to have positive intentions and express that to them. Something I found very helpful was saying that I'd like to learn it together, and that we could take turns. There'd be no acting like a chicken or embarrassing questions - just fun suggestions that improved everyone's qality of life.

5. Do hypnosis and be prepared to fail.  That is, even if you're succeeding, it might seem like you're failling.  For example, on my first two attempts with another person I successfully got a hand stick in place.  Beautiful. Then I transitioned into light and heavy arms. Fail! Oh well - I kept going and eventually screwed the whole thing up.  What I didn't realise, it actually worked. The participant felt their hand being tugged on - just not enough to rise.  All I needed to ask at the tie was, ""What does that feel like?"" and I could have saved the situation.

6. Go back and start from the beginning. Once you start failing, go back and find out what worked in after talk so you know what to fix. Remember that you're learning and that it will take time and practice.

Finally I highly, highly recommend James Tripp. There are two things he teaches that I recommend. The first is how he goes from soft analog tests to hard digital tests when he's doing his convincers.  The second is his whole 'No Fail Protocol'.  There is real treasure in what he teaches.

,hypnosis,"Hi, new here. I guess my question comes from a sense of curiosity. I would expect many of you have tried and successfully experience a ‘trance’.

,hypnosis,"I should probably start off by saying that I'm pretty much a complete stranger to hypnosis. I have never experienced it, and all I really know is that it's not as all-powerful as a lot of popular culture likes to depict it as. That being said, here is my question. 

I'm curious about the possibility of convincing myself (as an experiment) that I am someone else. Not someone who I know actually exists or a character from a story or franchise, but something alike to a fictional character that I create myself. 

Of course, it wouldn't be a complete change, as there are obviously going to be limitations to what I can/am going to achieve with this experiment. Some of these limitations are:

■ physical appearance

■ age

■ physical strength 

■ health (I know that some people get hypnotherapy for this, but it's not something this would focus on)

I'm thinking of changing personality, and possibly name and/or a few memories. Basically, if I were (hypothetically) an emotional and relaxed person with relaxed work ethic, would I be able to become someone who is less emotional and has a strict work ethic?
Also, would it be possible to change someone's recollection of their name? Making someone forget their name is one thing, but I'm wondering about changing someone's name. If one's name was Tim, and Tim remembers his name as John. Is that even in the realm of possibility, even if it's temporary?

,hypnosis,"Today I came across an interesting study in the book *[The Study of Time](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642653896)*. Researcher Bernard Aaronson hypnotized four male college students and suggested a condition to them, then awakened them, allowed them some free time, tested them with some psychological tests, had them interviewed by a psychologist or psychiatrist who was ignorant of the condition the subject was under, took them for a car ride, had some of them paint pictures, had them write accounts of their day, and afterward removed the condition.

&gt; The conditions included (1) no past, (2) no present, (3) no future, (4) no past and present, (5) no past and future, (6) no present and future, and (7) control. The contrasting set of conditions included (1) expanded past, (2) expanded present, (3) expanded future, (4) expanded past and present, (5) expanded past and future, (6) expanded present and future, and (7) control.

One of the four subjects was

&gt; a simulator, chosen for this task after extensive attempts to hypnotize him had failed to produce anything deeper than a light trance. The special task of the simulator was to act out the suggestions given as if he had been hypnotized. Only the experimenter knew that he was a simulator and not a true hypnotic subject.

All of the subjects had very intense experiences, including the simulator.

,hypnosis,"TLDR : **MKultra has reached a point against the general public where through psychological operations, the ""powers that be"" have convinced tens of thousands of willing participants to listen on loop to literal hypnosis with the intent of giving them mental disorders. Seems to be targeting people who watch sissy porn or have a hypnosis kink in addition to the general public.**  
This all started with me discovering a set of audio files called 'Bambi Sleep', a hypnosis program that describes itself as ""heavy feminization audio files particularly designed to enforce femininity and *transform the listener* into a very good girl. However, it is ***not  ""sissy"" hypnosis***."", they describe the sessions as covering ""many topics including obedience, ***amensia***, ***personality erasure***, ***mind control***, IQ reduction, body transformation, desire and addiction,  clothing, make-up, high heels, posture, mannerisms, voice, cocksucking, orgasm and pleasure triggers, and a variety of *enforcement techniques*."".

***Now let's hit pause on Bambi Sleep***, because it really is just a small part of this wild tale of online sex programming. BEAR IN MIND the fact that I believe hypnosis is NOT just a pseudoscience. If you don't believe that audio alone can change and control the human psyche just google ""Hemi Sync tapes for Astral Projection by the Monroe Institute of technology for CIA"".

Taking a stroll over to [r/EroticHypnosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/EroticHypnosis/) and [r/SissyHypno](https://www.reddit.com/r/SissyHypno/); they seems like run of the mill kink/fetish subreddits. ***Don't get me wrong***, there ***ARE*** *normal people there who just want to explore an innocent kink/fetish*. *HOWEVER, these subreddits are notable for being the largest hubs here on reddit in regard to this concerning subject.* Just the tip of the iceburg, they typically link people to smaller subreddits or sites with obviously nefarious purposes... like /r/[ShibbySays/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShibbySays/) (we'll get to THAT sub in a minute)... or even towards audio files like Bambi sleep.

**""MK-Ultra was a top-secret CIA project in which the agency conducted hundreds of clandestine experiments—sometimes on unwitting U.S. citizens—to assess the potential use of LSD and other drugs for mind control, information gathering and psychological torture.""**

In my opinion; when you start mixing hardcore sex acts with hypnosis meant to instill triggers in your brain, and combine that with widespread medication usage worldwide... you are getting DANGEROUSLY CLOSE to mkultra territory. That's what makes me SO CONCERNED with the idea of an audio series like Bambi Sleep, or subs similar to /r/ShibbySays that utilize advanced triggers and repetitive conditioning to achieve some form of ""hypnosis"". I strongly believe that this is the modern version of mkultra type experiments but on willing participants via the internet.

Me being someone very well educated on Dissociative Identity Disorder, MKUltra, Personalities- and Astral projection; this Bambi website immediately raised some red flags to me because of the carefully selected language used on their blog. ""**obedience**, ***amensia***, ***personality erasure***,  ***mind control""***

I soon discovered they had an active subreddit with 3000 users, a patreon raking in over $2500 USD a month, and a discord with over 10k users. ***Looks like a loosely organized sex programming cult to me.*** *(There are some 5x as big, bringing in 5x the profit that I found right as I was finished writing this post, they are linked at the bottom.)*

The discovery of this shocking set of audio files led me to wonder if there were perhaps more innocent but similarly strong forms of hypnosis available on the internet. Maybe something to do with tulpas? **I did not expect to find an endless rabbit hole of amateur hypnotists**. The search lead me to /r/ShibbySays, and to similar sketchy subreddits; and also to a suspicious site called ""***SOUNDGASM***"". The url is [https://soundgasm.net/](https://soundgasm.net/) , and upon loading the page it looks like it was developed by a two year old with a logo in plaintext reading ""soundgasm logo"".  Just an area to register and tons of file storage to upload audio. This is the dropbox of hypno porn. And if you search around on reddit you can quickly find links to hundreds of profiles for amateur hypnotists producing audio to break your brain in all sorts of ways.

**If this type of overt programming is willingly being undergone by organized participants online, what the FUCK is happening COVERTLY? in our music? our media? our PORN? Food for thought. Scary times we live in. Be safe people.**

Don't believe me? Still think this is just a kink/fetish? think hypnosis is bullshit? There’s a huge underground world of hypnotists and this is just one example of many out there. Below lies a huge dump of evidence, testimony, and links... feel free to leave your links and experiences in the comments :

""Many people do use hypnosis as just a kink but others go farther into it and do admire and try to emulate MK techniques and have permanently mentally damaged their victims. I’m sure actual MK programmers might be seen here and there but so far I’ve only come across the admirers.""

""Hypnosis does work and is a proven science and it’s being used throughout our lives on a daily basis by the media and entertainment businesses and they are very aware of it. ""

""A somnambulant is someone who is naturally extremely suggestible and are seen as the white  whale in the community due to how easily they slip into trance. About 5% of the population are somnambulant.""

Seems to be targeting people who watch sissy porn or have a hypnosis kink in addition to the general public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This all started with me discovering a set of audio files called &amp;#39;Bambi Sleep&amp;#39;, a hypnosis program that describes itself as &amp;quot;heavy feminization audio files particularly designed to enforce femininity and &lt;em&gt;transform the listener&lt;/em&gt; into a very good girl. However, it is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not  &amp;quot;sissy&amp;quot; hypnosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;, they describe the sessions as covering &amp;quot;many topics including obedience, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;amensia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;personality erasure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mind control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, IQ reduction, body transformation, desire and addiction,  clothing, make-up, high heels, posture, mannerisms, voice, cocksucking, orgasm and pleasure triggers, and a variety of &lt;em&gt;enforcement techniques&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s hit pause on Bambi Sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, because it really is just a small part of this wild tale of online sex programming. BEAR IN MIND the fact that I believe hypnosis is NOT just a pseudoscience. If you don&amp;#39;t believe that audio alone can change and control the human psyche just google &amp;quot;Hemi Sync tapes for Astral Projection by the Monroe Institute of technology for CIA&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"Hello everyone, I hope you are all having a great day/evening wherever you are.  I am going to start this post with my ask. I am looking to connect with a handful of folks who are willing to help me talk through some experiences I had and provide some feedback. Bonus point if we become friends :) . I'm not looking for a hypnotist to provide any services. I am in my mid 30's, self-employed, married, and have 2 beautiful children (1 &amp; 4) As you can imagine getting out and making friends can get tough! Below is my warp speed relevant topic back story but please don't feel obligated to read. Thank you!

I have been experimenting with hypnotism for years mostly listening to guided sessions online. It's a subject that has always interested me but I never fully explored. After sort of losing interest in hypnosis my life guided me towards psychedelics which I am an advocate for and use on occasion in a safe and respectable manner. They helped affected my life in a very positive way.

In 2020  I recently became aware of the 5th dimension after reading Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. That was in February.  By June my company sextupled in size. Now knowing the power of manifestation I naturally came back to my interest in hypnosis. I went through some sessions and did not really make much progress. My sessions in the past resulted in the same lack of progress. One night I combined both psychedelics and guided meditation and the increased quality of the experience was immeasurable. I am a very experienced consumer of the medicine and I took a very low dose. After doing just 2-3 sessions over a period of time I figured out (without research) how I could train my subconscious to support me in my conscious mission. 

Very recently I had the thought that maybe I could self hypnotize myself and influence my behavior. There is this one particular bad habit that has been plaguing me for 10+ years. I sat down and did some research on the topic and started writing a script. Since that day I have not felt the urge to perform that bad habit. Since that day I am completely in love with the subject and want to learn as much as I can. I am already reading Trancework which is an invaluable asset.

I am going to start this post with my ask. I am looking to connect with a handful of folks who are willing to help me talk through some experiences I had and provide some feedback. Bonus point if we become friends :) . I&amp;#39;m not looking for a hypnotist to provide any services. I am in my mid 30&amp;#39;s, self-employed, married, and have 2 beautiful children (1 &amp;amp; 4) As you can imagine getting out and making friends can get tough! Below is my warp speed relevant topic back story but please don&amp;#39;t feel obligated to read. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with hypnotism for years mostly listening to guided sessions online. It&amp;#39;s a subject that has always interested me but I never fully explored. After sort of losing interest in hypnosis my life guided me towards psychedelics which I am an advocate for and use on occasion in a safe and respectable manner. They helped affected my life in a very positive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020  I recently became aware of the 5th dimension after reading Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. That was in February.  By June my company sextupled in size. Now knowing the power of manifestation I naturally came back to my interest in hypnosis. I went through some sessions and did not really make much progress. My sessions in the past resulted in the same lack of progress. One night I combined both psychedelics and guided meditation and the increased quality of the experience was immeasurable. I am a very experienced consumer of the medicine and I took a very low dose. After doing just 2-3 sessions over a period of time I figured out (without research) how I could train my subconscious to support me in my conscious mission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very recently I had the thought that maybe I could self hypnotize myself and influence my behavior. There is this one particular bad habit that has been plaguing me for 10+ years. I sat down and did some research on the topic and started writing a script. Since that day I have not felt the urge to perform that bad habit. Since that day I am completely in love with the subject and want to learn as much as I can. I am already reading Trancework which is an invaluable asset. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening if you made it this far. &lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"First of all I’ve been into hypnosis since I hypnotised my friends at the age of 14 (now 32). I’ve been to several hypnotherapist over the years, some times going under, most times not at all. I’ve also listened to plenty of self hypnosis over the decade, and have gone into some deep trances, and have had powerful changes brought about. The last 5 years I’ve created many self hypnosis files myself, this is where most of my changes came about, and these were text to speech.

However with all my years of self hypnosis, I’ve always had trouble going into trance. It didn’t matter how many times I’ve been in trance, how deep I’ve been (to the point of natural amnesia), or how many suggestions I’ve given myself to help trance; I’ve always been one of those people who could never make it second nature. This caused problems, where when I would get a hypnosis file to work strongly, a lot of the times it would only work temporarily and then fade over days, because I had trouble going into trance to reinforce the suggestions from that file.

Now this could be because of my own mental issues I suffer with. OCD, anhedonia, being analytical/perfectionist, and just not being able to let go when listening. But I made a good analogy of why trancing to hypnosis isn’t always second nature for people however much they practice... insomnia.

We have entered into the sleep state half of our lives. We are well trained of that state, we’ve done it 10,000’s of times. And yet people who suffer from insomnia, even though they’ve gone to sleep countless times, just have a very hard time getting there. So in this case it doesn’t matter how many times a person has practiced being in the sleep state, getting there is still not second nature for them. And I honestly think it is the exact same thing when it comes to hypnosis.

Now lets talk about Instant Self Hypnosis. It’s barely talked about anywhere in the hypnosis community online and offline, but it’s a genuine contribution to hypnosis and its method.

I had the book over a decade ago now, but didn’t put much effort into it. It’s basically where you hypnotise yourself by reading to yourself with your eyes open, first the induction, then you read a script, then you read a wake up. Now before we go any further, I had a thought today while practicing it (another analogy). We all know that in stage hypnosis (and clinical hypnosis) people can be in hypnosis with their eyes open, so why not during self hypnosis?

Anyway I started giving it a good try, remember this is someone who has been experimenting with hypnosis and self hypnosis for decades now and never got good at “going into trance”. But every time I do this method, I always feel I’m in a light trance/hypnosis. Maybe the reading helps the critical mind to focus and prevent the analytical mind, I’m not sure. Also the first few times I did it, I gave myself trance/hypnosis helping suggestions. But all the time I spent doing this with self hypnosis files, it never helped. But with this method I feel guaranteed trance every time.

As for my successes, there’s been progress in various things. While I will not say the suggestions affect me as instantly as when I’ve listened to a file in a deep trance with the same suggestion repeating/compounding. There have been enough results to give me confidence that this method truly works, it is a real self hypnosis method.

To some people here, this is obvious it could work, we go into trance all the time, blah blah.

,hypnosis,"Hey guys, I checked the mod post and didn’t see anything that jumped out that made me think this has been answered already but if I’m wrong I apologize!
I hope this is also the right place to go. I had a really odd experience today during an appointment with my hypnotherapist and i am curious about others’ takes on it.

So this is only the second time I’ve ever been put under hypnosis. My therapist has been doing it for years and is very good at what she does; I was referred to her from my primary therapist who I’ve been seeing to help me cope with some pretty severe grief/loss/anxiety/PTSD stuff. 

So the first time I went under, I was honestly really surprised. I have ADD big time and I’ve always been kinda convinced hypnosis wouldn’t work for me just cuz of how my mind is going a million miles an hour all the time but man it went great and even my therapist was quite surprised with how easily I went under.

Today something kinda...weird happened though and I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this. So I was pretty deep under, and all of a sudden in my, uh, minds eye I guess? I saw - and man, it felt really fuckin real - two dogs run in, kinda make a quarter turn, and disappeared. I tried to ignore it but then, again very suddenly, two PEOPLE were next to me. I couldn’t see their faces. A taller male I think and a smaller person, maybe a kid. It was jarring and real enough that my eyes flew open and We had to end that specific session (as far as the hypnotism went). My therapist appeared surprised; she asked me a lot of questions that I don’t want to get into here but like...do you guys know what this might be about? It felt like the image was straight up implanted in my head - not like the therapist did it, but like...I’m gonna assume y’all aren’t coming at this from like a woo woo spooky perspective but the only thing I can compare the sensation to is this time I saw an entity in a similar way.


I am very aware that this probably sounds insane. I assure you that while I have a lot of struggles that have led to me being a pretty depressed person, I am by no means psychotic nor have I ever been delusional. It’s just confusing. Is this just like a thing that happens? Any insight? I didn’t feel threatened or anything - I simply didn’t know who the people I “saw” were, nor was I familiar with the dogs. It felt like they kinda all just crash landed in my head. Idk. 

Please don’t ridicule me I’m just looking for answers and tbh I’m having a very bad time and don’t want to be a troll target or made fun of.

,hypnosis,"I've been struggling with multiple issues for a long time.  Depression, anxiety, procrastination, weight loss, etc.  Recently I've been listening to a Surf City hypnosis app for weight loss, and I've lost 20 lb in the past month.  I've also been working on other goals, which have helped my anxiety and depression.

However, procrastination has really been getting in the way of many of my goals, and has threatened my work.  So I've started listening to their procrastination app, and it's been helping a lot.  The problem is that my weight loss has stopped as I've been listening to the procrastination app, and some unhealthy habits have been creeping back in.

The consensus in my last post is that I should focus on just one thing at a time in my hypnosis.  I had been planning on writing my own script to consolidate the two topics, as well as adding a custom third topic to improve my relationships with my family.

Depression, anxiety, procrastination, weight loss, etc.  Recently I&amp;#39;ve been listening to a Surf City hypnosis app for weight loss, and I&amp;#39;ve lost 20 lb in the past month.  I&amp;#39;ve also been working on other goals, which have helped my anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, procrastination has really been getting in the way of many of my goals, and has threatened my work.  So I&amp;#39;ve started listening to their procrastination app, and it&amp;#39;s been helping a lot.  The problem is that my weight loss has stopped as I&amp;#39;ve been listening to the procrastination app, and some unhealthy habits have been creeping back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consensus in my last post is that I should focus on just one thing at a time in my hypnosis.  I had been planning on writing my own script to consolidate the two topics, as well as adding a custom third topic to improve my relationships with my family.  I thought that by listening to it as I went to sleep, I could do a longer session that hits all three topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is a bad idea, then does anyone have some ideas on how can I listen to the procrastination hypnosis recording without losing my progress made with the weight loss recording?

,hypnosis,"I'm a beginnig hypnotist.
I've heard and read a number of deepeners, and I'm trying to understand the principles that cause someone to go deeper into trance. This is to hopefully be able to craft deepeners that will work well for a given subject, particularly someone new to hypnosis

Many deepeners seek to focus on having the subject ""relax"" further, but I don't think that's the real goal, and can be confusing to a subject who says internally ""but I'm already completely relaxed."" Even the suggestion to ""go deeper"" could be confusing to someone unfamiliar with trance (e.g. ""how do I go deeper?"").

Some things that makes sense to me:
Deepening occurs as the subject increases their focus, hence relaxation could be a thing to focus on. The imagery and suggestions in a deepener are ways to guide the focus of the subject.
Deepening occurs as the subject ""thinks"" less, as their mind becomes less busy and more quiet. Focus is a means of doing this.

,hypnosis,"I (22f) have been dabbling in hypnosis since I was about 13 or 14. I've tried simple relaxation hypnosis, sleep/dream hypnosis, and erotic hypnosis, as well as several others. I have the mindset of wanting to be hypnotized, wanting to release my inhibitions and open my mind to suggestions. I'm always excited or looking forward to hypnosis, as I think it's a really interesting concept and I want it to work. I always *want* to be hypnotized.

However, I've had the same issue for as long as I've been listening to hypnosis: once I get into trance, or what I think is trance, my heart rate starts increasing, and my body starts to tremble. Little shivers at first, but if I listen long enough, it turns into body-racking shakes. It takes me out of trance and I usually end up stopping the track, and I never really feel like it works because the shaking and quick heart rate wake me up.

I've tried making sure I'm warm so I don't get cold chills, I've tried putting it on when I'm on the verge of falling asleep so I'm as relaxed as possible, I've tried listening to ones without binaural beats or music, I try as hard as I can to keep my breathing steady without making it feel too forced. Nothing works. As soon as I start going into trance, I start shaking and I hate it.

I want hypnosis to work for me *so badly.* I think it's helpful and a lot of it is just damn fun.

,hypnosis,"I read a comic recently that really got me thinking, and I feel it would make an interesting discussion here. The comic is about willpower and quitting smoking. [Here it is](http://existentialcomics.com/comic/13), though I should note that it's not an easy one to read if you're not all about academic philosophy, so you may instead prefer to read my summary:

&gt; Sanus is lighting up a cigarette when his friend, Amencia confronts him: ""I thought you were going to quit?""

&gt; Sanus replies ""I guess I just don't have the willpower.""

&gt; Amencia then launches into a diatribe about willpower. He says that ""Your will is the manifestation of your desires; your desire is for a cigarette, your willpower is your ability to enact that desire over external forces"". He says that the Sanus who decided in the past to quit smoking cannot be thought of the same Sanus who is currently smoking. Therefore, the Sanus who wanted to quit can be considered an external force. Esentially, past-Sanus is ordering present-Sanus not to smoke, and present-Sanus is exerting his willpower in resisting the orders of past-Sanus.

&gt; Framed in this way, it doesn't take willpower to quit smoking; it takes *obedience*. Amencia says that there is an institution that produces people who can stick what they set out to do: people with self-mastery and discipline. And that institution is the military. The military does not teach their recruits to be willful. They teach obedience. Their recruits must learn to follow the orders of their superiors. *That* is discipline.

&gt; Amencia concludes ""The term 'self-mastery' is a misnomer: 'self-servitude' they should say! For anyone can play at being the master by simply voicing empty commands into the future. But it becomes an actuality only when the self of the future becomes the servant.""

And I think that has interesting implications for hypnotists. Subjects tend to feel that willpower means that their minds are strong, that they can resist the will of the hypnotist. But if you look at it in this way, strength is being able to follow orders when the orders are right, in spite of your strong desires to do the wrong thing.

&lt;p&gt;Yet every time I approach them or do them, I get this electric shock feeling in my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My chest and belly contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: I feel anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this I point out, that exposure by itself does not make it less, because I expose myself often to triggering events. The fear/anxiety stays.&lt;/p&gt;

,hypnosis,"I know, I said I'd post the results two weeks later. I don't know what I was thinking. Most the results always come in within the first three days. It's been almost five now, so I feel this is a good time to end it.

So I had you guys answer questions on Susan Young's ADHD Questionnaire. Her version was over a hundred questions, but I shortened it to the 20 most informative questions. She divided the questions into four factors, which I'm calling Attention, Emotion, Delinquency, and Social. The thing most people don't realize is that ADHD isn't one solid disorder--it's a very wide array of symptoms, and it's possible for two people to have ADHD and not share any of the symptoms. That's why I wanted to analyze the different factors separately. I also scored you on all the factors combined.

Then you watched a hypnosis video by Ella Enchanting. Thank you /u/ellaenchanting for making such fine content!

In the third section, you answered questions from the Hypnotic Experience Questionnaire Short Form, which I've used in all of my previous hypnosis research on this subreddit, and much of the research I've done elsewhere too. This questionnaire is divided into three parts: Rapport, Relaxation, and Dissociation.

I got a total of 61 responses, and now we can finally see the connection between ADHD and susceptibility, which is ...

*drumroll*

... nothing at all!

This totally blew my mind, guys. I've never seen so little correlation on one of my studies before. I think we were all expecting there to be a significant link between ADHD and hypnotic susceptibility. I know I certainly was. But it's just not there.

So when I do these studies, I use conditional formatting. Anything with over a 30% correlation gets a slight color on it, red for negative, green for positive. If the correlation is higher than 50%, it gets a more vibrant color.

[Here's the results.](https://imgur.com/oAEfRd6)

So that upper-left area that's lit up like a Christmas tree? That's correlations between ADHD questions and ADHD factors. That doesn't have anything to do with hypnosis. That's just about how Young's ADHD Questionnaire works.

And that bright-green area in the lower middle? That's correlations between the Hypnotic Experience Questionnaire factors and the Hypnotic Esperience Questionnaire questions. Doesn't have anything to do with ADHD.

Everything on the right side is correlations between individual questions. The upper section is ADHD questions correlating with each other. The lower section is ADHD questions correlating with hypnosis questions.

The two sections with bold outlines are the important stuff. The upper middle one is hypnosis factors correlating with ADHD questions. The lower left is ADHD factors correlating with hypnosis questions. Both sections are almost completely white because there's pretty much no correlation whatsoever.

The Attention factor has a slight correlation with these items:

* My thoughts took on a life of their own

* My experience was a blend of imagination and reality

The Delinquency factor, and ADHD as a whole also had a slight correlation with the second question.

The Relaxation and Rapport factors had a slight correlation with

* I am outgoing and friendly

Relaxation had a slight correlation with 

* I enjoy the company of others

And Dissociation had a slight correlation with 

* I have often been inattentive, and easily distracted

And that's it.

Really, all of this is negligible. There just doesn't seem to be any connection between ADHD and hypnosis whatsoever.

**Edit:** Initially I was dumbfounded by this, but now it's starting to make sense to me. People typically don't tell you they have ADHD when the session worked. But whenever someone has trouble being hypnotized, if they have ADHD, they'll be sure to mention it. And something like 10% of all people have been diagnosed with ADHD. A hypnotist is likely to hear ""Maybe it didn't work because of my ADHD"" very often.

,hypnosis,"I've been training in hypnotherapy online and am trying to decide whether to go into practice or not.  So bear with me for being a hassle and I wonder people's opinion.  Basically I've gotten really depressed with it.  I feel basically like I'd like to be a real therapist but can't afford the training and have maybe wasted time on something a little silly.  Or have I?  Hypnosis is interesting, maybe I need to lighten up and roll with it, and when I get good and see changes happening in people, questions will answer themselves...

Here is why I have doubt:

* It seems like a lot of the psychology associated is heavily bullshit or at minimum ridiculously simplistic.  If you compare something like the Jungian view of the mind with the idea that it's all just beliefs for you to go in and change...  It all feels pretty cringe.
* Some of the techniques, like parts negotiation, really strike me as bullshit.  Or at least the official explanation.  Am I really talking to a part of the person's mind directly?  Seems to me unlikely and again pretty cringe.
* Overall my class has a cultish character and is populated by people who generally seem ready to glom onto any superficial healing technique with no evidence / tradition / logic behind it.  If you question anything, they get upset at you for being negative.  I feel we're all constantly ""treating"" each other and giving each other pats on the back and nothing much happens.  Don't get me wrong, I am an occultist, I just don't like my wackiness to be superficial or MLM.
* Fwiw, I've been quite down, and keep having people try to hypnotize me not to be down, and tell me that since I still am, I must not want to change, so that's really soured me on this.

On the other hand:

\* I know hypnosis works well for things like smoking &amp; weight control, and it seems logical that it would, basically you just need a little persuasive, imagine it differently push.

* OK, hypnosis is real, so I guess one could just do it and use a different patter that feels less cringe and bullshit?  Maybe I just need to find different techniques, different teachers that resonate better with my beliefs or work on developing my own styles &amp; skill?
* Maybe I'm focusing too much on whether the theories are true and just should focus on that they work and it doesn't really matter why, it's good enough that the person believes the talking hand puppet is their mind part and let's themselves make a wanted change.

- How long did it roughly take? How you increased your ""body count""? Free too, not only paying clients.

- Did you make your certifications first or did you experiment paralel with education?

- Did you specialised on treating something or you were more generalist type of business?

---I thought, this state is very similar to what people encourage others to do for astral travel/OBE. So with enough concentration and focus would it be possible to go from a deep hypnotic state to your astral/ethereal body?? 

And before anyone says its the same as sleep, maybe its just me personally but I feel able to have more control of my consciousness going into self hypnosis during the day. Than I do trying to focus on an astral body at night. It may just be whats working for me right now, not sure.

,hypnosis,"I'm hoping to overcome my insomina with hypnosis, but I don't know where to begin.

PROBLEM: I've dealt with insomnia for 10+ years (anxiety is the cause). My insomnia was very bad in my mid-20s, but I started using meditation and CBT techniques before bed, and that helped mitigate things. About a year ago, I was able to fall asleep within 10-15 mins. 

Now, however, it's 30-45 mins. And I go through this annoying ritual where I take half a melatonin tablet, lie down, get up to meditate, use the bathroom, take the other half of the melatonin tablet, lie down again, get up to meditate again, use the bathroom again, and finally fall asleep.

Most recently I've been waking up early and struggling to get back to sleep (usually I try meditating again). This is killing me, as it's costing me 1-2 hours of sleep.

NEED HELP: I'm not sure where to start with hypnosis. I've seen people recommend books on self-hypnosis, YouTube videos, and hypnotherapy sessions. Not sure what to try first. Would listening to a YouTube hypnosis video before bed (or while lying in bed) be a good start?

,hypnosis,"Hi,

I’m a big believer in hypnosis and have used self-hypnosis CDs in the past which I found had worked.  
I went to a professional hypnotherapist a few months ago, to get a couple of specific goals (both different areas) for one session.   
They didn’t use a script and it felt very general. I did feel a bit different afterwards and had a bit of extra motivation. However, it wasn’t long before I was questioning the session due to the lack of script. 

Fast forward to present and I’m really questioning if it was a waste of time. I have read that experienced hypnotherapists don’t need to read a script and have heard one hypnotherapist say the subconscious already knows what to do. 

I guess my expectation was that a script was used to reprogram my mind regarding my aims, and then I’d get a recording to use for 21 days. 

I don’t feel my blocks have been removed, I can especially tell with one of my issues, my thinking hasn’t progressed at all and I’m no better off than before the session.

,hypnosis,"I see this question come up a lot so I thought I'd answer it. I use the Elman induction in my recordings that I make for myself because it is quick and easy.  In the Elman Induction there are 5 steps. I'll go over those now and how to incorporate them into your recordings (note that this can be shortened for more experienced people and that this is an excessively long Elman intro).

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Eye relaxation** \- during this step you are instructing yourself to relax your eyes. It will look something like the following, ""\[find a comfortable position etc.\] and when you are ready, simply close your eyes. In a moment I'll count from 3 to 1 and with each number relax your eyes and eyelids deeper. Starting with 3, feel all the muscles around your eyes start to relax and release their tension. 2, noticing your eyelids becoming still, and noting that if they are still moving, it is a sign of them trying to relax, and that is a good sign. And 1, not worrying about any movement that might be left, and having confidence that with each breath out you take your eye lids relax more and more.  
""Now notice that quality of relaxation, and know that if you keep that quality of relaxation you simply won't be able to open them.  And if you want to now, go ahead and try to open them and notice that even as you try to open them you can easily hold that quality of relaxation, and if you do, they simply cannot open.'  
... or something like that.
2. **Body Relaxation** \- This is super easy and quick. It goes something like, ""And now, you might find it easy to imagine that relaxation spread all throughout your body. That's right, with each breath out now you could imagine it spreading further down your body, down your arms... your chest... into your abdomen... through your legs. Completely relaxed.
3. **Fractionation** \- This is exactly the same as a usual Elman (albeit without waving hands and such). Something like, ""And in a moment your going to greatly deepen your relaxation, because when I say 'open your eyes' you'll let your eyes open, and when I say 'shut your eyes,' you'll let them close again, but as you let them close you'll double your relaxation, and go down twice as deep. Ready? Open you eyes \[count 1.. 2..\] and close them. Doubling that relaxation, and feeling yourself travel deeper down. \[Pause\] and again... \[then do the process two more times\].
4. **Arm Drop Deepener** \- This is where things get tricky.  There are two things happening here. First, this step is a deepener. Secondly, it is a convincer. Finally, it is a test to check for muscle catalepsy. *Because you have first hand information about whether you're completely relaxed, it is not needed, but replaced with something else*.  Here are my suggestions. Firstly, you could do a **staircase deepener**. Super easy, but do a good one.  These are tricky to learn to do well and I'm happy to do another post on that. Better yet, do an **arm stick** test. Basic steps are to tell yourself to imagine now something warm and sticky spreading along your hand, flowing all around, even under your fingers. The more it flows, the more it sticks until  you hand starts to feel really stuck. Then instruct yourself to give a *little* test to see how your fingers feel stuck. If that works, intensify the stickiness, spread it up the arm, and then go for a bigger test.... 'and now relax...' Don't forget to unstick and go back to relaxation.  
If this is done well you've done your own convincer and test. If it doesn't, do a few more PMR scripts on youtube for practice and then try again.
5. **Suggested Amnesia** \- This is the straightforward. I would do something like this, ""And now that your body is completely relaxed, and with each breath out relaxing more deeply still, it might be nice for your mind to enter a similar state of relaxation. So in a moment you can start counting slowly backwards from 100.  And with each number you mind can grow more relaxed, more serene. And as your mind grows more relaxed, it might become more and more difficult to recall what comes next, and that is a good sign that your mind it becoming more relaxed, until those numbers just fade away. So in a moment I'm going to give you some time to relax your mind counting backwards from 100 until all those numbers are gone.  Now, shortly I'll start talking again, and when I do you'll know that you can take that as a sign to relax more deeply still, but right now start counting backwards from 100 \[wait 30-60 seconds\].

And that's it.  I would then move into the suggestion phase.  It would go something like this. 'As you find yourself now, continuing to drift downward in this peaceful state you can easily notice that your subconscious mind is more receptive to authentic ideas and deeper levels of meaning, because you've chosen to come to this place and this state, and to make positive change. \[etc\]

,hypnosis,"

Hello all.
I've been lurking on here for a while but never posted. I prefer to observe and research and never really felt I had anything to add. I hesitated to make this thread for a few weeks as it's just a repeat of so many others, but I need some advice if anyone is willing.

I've been on somewhat of a journey over the last few years. I'm trying to address mental health concerns that have reduced my quality of life for a long time. My therapist suggested I branch out into modalities beyond just CBT in hopes of finding tools that may be more effective. I decided to pursue hypnosis among other things as it's been something I found interesting since childhood.
I'm sure you've probably guessed already where this is going, but I'm not having any meaningful success. I've listened to dozens of hours of audio from a variety of different creators, and have seen two separate licensed Hypnotherapists. My results have been disappointing, frustrating, and at times downright depressing.

The Hypnotherapists were not great experiences. The first was a woman who was friendly enough, but didn't really seem that engaged. Her inductions and therapy were repetitive, and when I struggled to reach any kind of useful trance state she seemed  to give up. She recommended I try a different therapist who may have a different approach than her. Fair enough.
The second was more frustrating. He was very engaged and excited to do his job, but again I struggled to reach any kind of useful state. Rather than recognize this, he insisted each time that I'd been hypnotized and everything was exactly as it should be. I found this hard to accept as I'd continually failed every convincer and depth test, and experienced nothing different from simply closing my eyes and thinking about something. His insistence started to diminish our rapport after several sessions, and eventually I decided I couldn't justify paying his rate for what amounted to little more than someone telling me to close my eyes and use my imagination. He seemed offended at the end, and believed it was my subconscious telling me to quit as a means of resisting change. If that was true, I'm sorry to say my subconscious was successful.

I've since spent months researching the topic and trying to accomplish what I can on my own. I can say I have accomplished much more from determination and repetition than I was ever able to experience with the therapists. Unfortunately, I've hit a wall that I can't seem to pass. I believe I'm achieving a light trance state at times with certain audio recordings, but it's difficult and not always reliable. I've yet to experience a single instance of hypnotic phenomena, and the suggestibility just doesn't seem to be there. I recognize the telltale signs of trance, but the internal experiences are neither vivid nor realistic in any way.
I believe there is still hope though. At times I do seem to lose myself in a level of engagement and focus, but it never lasts for more than a second or two. Trying to go beyond a certain level of focus or depth seems to trigger a reflex that causes me to pull back from what's happening. I've been trying to relax and allow myself to move forward for quite some time, but this jolt seems as reliable a reflex as a doctor's tap to your knee, and is just as involuntary.

I've invested a lot of time and effort into this, and it's a tool I would very dearly like to have. If nothing else, it's an experience I want that's been out of my reach.

I&amp;#39;ve been lurking on here for a while but never posted. I prefer to observe and research and never really felt I had anything to add. I hesitated to make this thread for a few weeks as it&amp;#39;s just a repeat of so many others, but I need some advice if anyone is willing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on somewhat of a journey over the last few years. I&amp;#39;m trying to address mental health concerns that have reduced my quality of life for a long time. My therapist suggested I branch out into modalities beyond just CBT in hopes of finding tools that may be more effective. I decided to pursue hypnosis among other things as it&amp;#39;s been something I found interesting since childhood.
I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve probably guessed already where this is going, but I&amp;#39;m not having any meaningful success. I&amp;#39;ve listened to dozens of hours of audio from a variety of different creators, and have seen two separate licensed Hypnotherapists. My results have been disappointing, frustrating, and at times downright depressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hypnotherapists were not great experiences. The first was a woman who was friendly enough, but didn&amp;#39;t really seem that engaged. Her inductions and therapy were repetitive, and when I struggled to reach any kind of useful trance state she seemed  to give up. She recommended I try a different therapist who may have a different approach than her. Fair enough.
The second was more frustrating. He was very engaged and excited to do his job, but again I struggled to reach any kind of useful state. Rather than recognize this, he insisted each time that I&amp;#39;d been hypnotized and everything was exactly as it should be. I found this hard to accept as I&amp;#39;d continually failed every convincer and depth test, and experienced nothing different from simply closing my eyes and thinking about something. His insistence started to diminish our rapport after several sessions, and eventually I decided I couldn&amp;#39;t justify paying his rate for what amounted to little more than someone telling me to close my eyes and use my imagination. He seemed offended at the end, and believed it was my subconscious telling me to quit as a means of resisting change. If that was true, I&amp;#39;m sorry to say my subconscious was successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve since spent months researching the topic and trying to accomplish what I can on my own. I can say I have accomplished much more from determination and repetition than I was ever able to experience with the therapists. Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;ve hit a wall that I can&amp;#39;t seem to pass. I believe I&amp;#39;m achieving a light trance state at times with certain audio recordings, but it&amp;#39;s difficult and not always reliable. I&amp;#39;ve yet to experience a single instance of hypnotic phenomena, and the suggestibility just doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be there. I recognize the telltale signs of trance, but the internal experiences are neither vivid nor realistic in any way.
I believe there is still hope though. At times I do seem to lose myself in a level of engagement and focus, but it never lasts for more than a second or two. Trying to go beyond a certain level of focus or depth seems to trigger a reflex that causes me to pull back from what&amp;#39;s happening. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to relax and allow myself to move forward for quite some time, but this jolt seems as reliable a reflex as a doctor&amp;#39;s tap to your knee, and is just as involuntary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve invested a lot of time and effort into this, and it&amp;#39;s a tool I would very dearly like to have. If nothing else, it&amp;#39;s an experience I want that&amp;#39;s been out of my reach. I recognize overlap with other areas of my life that I&amp;#39;m struggling with and I really do believe a breakthrough on this would have significant benefit for me. I&amp;#39;m not sure how to address this though. I would be very sad to have to accept defeat and give up on ever experiencing this, but if that&amp;#39;s the reality of the situation then it is what it is I suppose.

I had another past relationship with another girl, And she was super close to getting raped by a stranger. She got lucky, I was there on phone, and we were able to send him to Jail.

After that incident, she had panic issues. And asked me to help her to forget about it but keep the fear just to protect herself and avoid such situations.

The hypnosis session was successful and it worked. But I did something stupid again.

I accidentally quoted a message from the past that related to that past incident, and she clicked on it and went through the conversation which I made her forget by a hypnosis session.

Suddenly she grabbed her head and started to scream out loud saying ""My head hurts...! Please help me...! help me...!!""

I noticed what happened, then I was able to hypnotize her fast, She managed to focus on my words somehow while having the pain in her head, and I made her forget what she recently read, and erased all chats, that's how she got back to normal.

,hypnosis,"I've been gone for a while due to being busy, but recently I revisited some topics tangentially related to hypnosis, and it's led me to reconsider my stance on how the fast phobia cure works. I thought I'd share with you guys, because FPC has been discussed several times here and I think often the discussion was extremely terse and it was sometimes hard to tell what points exactly people were trying to make (and I'm not excluding myself from this). So, here's more detail than anyone ever asked for.

**My model of the mind in a nutshell**

I view all cognitive patterns as chains of associations, roughly speaking. Any stimulus – internal or external – gets mixed together with all of the current ""state"" (what's in your working set and radius of perception), weighted by how relevant/notable it is deemed by your mind, and then a rapid search gets kicked off that finds all ""matching"" associations - again, weighted by relevance. These then get activated automatically. They might be memories, thoughts, emotions, ...

The difficulty in any naive attempt of getting rid of an unwanted association is that every time you trigger it, all of the existing associations come up immediately, and whatever you want to happen instead couldn't possibly have enough of an association weight in your mind to compete with any of that. Logically, there are two ways to work around that: either make the new thing ""powerful"" (= strong emotions) enough to compete, or find a way to temporarily bypass the existing associations, so you can start building up the new association in the absence of serious competitors.

Of course, in any real world scenario, this is rather more complex than this very simple description makes it appear, due to the sheer number of stimuli and associations, and the number of links in a chain of associations.

Furthermore, as seems apparent from the study of mindfulness, a chain will always get drowned out by the default mode network or other stimuli eventually, unless the chain reinforces itself (""loops""). I believe that this happens because of meta-cognition (you read something into your inner experience that reinforces it). Mindfulness, then, works by biasing the meta-cognition away from what it does to keep the loop going, but anything else that interrupts the meta-cognition should stop the loop in the present moment, too.

Contrived and vastly simplified example: suppose you're afraid of waffles. You spot one and that kicks off a fear response. You think ""I need to stop feeling this but I can't, omigosh"" and that focuses you even more on the fear, amplifying it. In a sense, you bounce back and forth between being aware of your fear and ""cognizing"" that you can't control it. The key insight for mindfulness is that while you probably can't ""turn off"" the feeling, you *can* interpret it differently. If you can *congruently* think to yourself, ""I'm feeling this powerful fear now, but it will fade soon"", that eliminates the amplifying factor. In fact as soon as you can believe it (e.g. because you've practiced mindfulness on ever more powerful cognitive responses), it becomes a self-fulfilling suggestion to yourself.

Now, this makes mindfulness a viable solution to get rid of any conditioning, but most likely not an instant one. Generally, I believe it will serve to ""train away"" the meta-cognition that reinforces the unwanted pattern - but it does not directly eliminate the initial trigger of the cognitive chain. For instance, a phobia of waffles always kicks in if the concept of a waffle enters your present mental state, and that will immediately fire up a fear response. That fear response doesn't stick around if you break the meta-cognition that keeps it looping around, but that only makes it fade out while you do that. Over (some amount of) time, as you keep doing that, the fear will fade out more easily and that will contribute to the overall response fading, too, until the waffle only makes you remember that you used to be afraid, if anything.

This is not what the FPC seems to be doing - it seems to be rather more rapid (and still quite permanent). So what's going on?

**On FPC as backward conditioning**

I've seen here, several times, the notion that the fast phobia cure is ""just backward conditioning"". I don't think this is a good explanation of what's going on, nor ""true"" in any meaningful way.

I believe this is based on an overly formulaic application of what is known about classical conditioning and backward conditioning. Let's revisit the basics really quickly.

Classical conditioning: pair a conditioned stimulus (CS) which is typically neutral with an unconditioned stimulus (US) which is typically ""potent"" and has a pre-existing unconditioned response (UR). The conditioning process, especially if repeated, results in a conditioned response (CR) to the CS that is often similar to the UR (but doesn't have to be - at which point you can start wondering if the formula is maybe a little incomplete).

In short: CS+(US+UR) = CS+CR

When pairing the two stimuli, usually the CS comes first, then the US; this is called forward conditioning. If you turn it around - US first, then CS, three things can happen: either the conditioning is reinforced, it is not significantly affected, or it is diminished. A quick survey of the literature finds that reinforcement is dubious, and both neutral and diminishing results are possible. At least one study that tried to nail this down further found that only if you restrict your trials to traditional Pavlovian conditioning (where the US is a potent biological stimulus rather than a purely cognitive object), you consistently get inhibition.

The problem is that almost nothing about phobias is Pavlovian. The fear response is the only ""biologically potent"" element in the equation, and it's not present as a stimulus, but as the response. And more generally, what exactly do US, UR, CS and CR map to in a phobia? I suppose CS is seeing the waffle, CR is the fear response... but what is represented by US and UR? For the sake of this discussion, let's assume the phobia developed because a waffle bit you and it was extremely painful (and let's not talk about the fact that many people get bitten by waffles without developing a phobia, because then we'd have to face the fact that phobias are a little more complicated than this). The pain, then, is a biologically potent response, so it can serve as the UR. Then, maybe the bite is the US. It's really the only thing I can think of if we try to map this whole thing out as purely Pavlovian.

Backward conditioning, in the only form that has been found to work more or less consistently, then, would require biting someone without having them see (or think of) a waffle. That doesn't really look like a FPC to me...

I mean, we all *have* to agree that there is something going on on a cognitive level, because classical conditioning is known to extinguish if you repeatedly present someone with the CS without the US going on. On a purely behaviourist level, only the bite could possibly be the US, but the phobia will keep going even if the person is never bitten by a waffle again. In other words, the conditioning that makes a phobia work definitely involves conditioning on a cognitive level (CS and CR are cognitively constructed), otherwise it wouldn't survive a bunch of waffles that don't bite. Now, if you want to argue that the FPC is essentially backward conditioning *but* on a cognitive level, I'm afraid that science doesn't really back you up on that. There are solid findings for Pavlovian backward conditioning resulting in extinction, but not for ""non-Pavlovian"" (cognitive) backward conditioning – at least I could not find any.

Does the FPC result in extinction? It certainly seems so! But not due to backward conditioning, if you ask me.

**On FPC as ""reversing pathways""**

This is one I've seen several times in NLP materials. Basically the claim is that the temporal reversal magically undoes the existing chain of associations. I am entirely unconvinced.

But let's assume for a moment that it's true - that reversing a sequence somehow neutralizes the original from the mind, removing the energy and emotion and stuff. By that logic, if I'm a member of a band and I'm performing live on stage, I should probably never leave the stage again, because it's the reverse of entering the stage! Next time I go on stage I won't be able to feel the anticipation anymore because it has been neutralized. I may never again enjoy a stage performance...

If you think that this is a ridiculous example, of course you're right... but I think it's just barely not-ridiculous enough to illustrate a little snag: reversals of sequences happen so often in everyday life that all of us would have noticed a significant effect by now if they were somehow magical. (To the people who have used VHS tapes – did rewinding a tape ever seem to unexpectedly ruin all the rewatchings for you?)

**Let's try again...**

So, what *does* the FPC do? Recall that by my model, there are two ways to change a powerful association: somehow inhibit the existing associations (e.g. *external inhibition* in conditioning lingo) or hype up the new association.

There isn't really any noticeable hyping up in the FPC, but there is an inhibitory element, and it's the key of what makes the FPC work: dissociation (typically using the ""movie hall"" frame). By dissociating from the experience as it ""plays out"", you distance yourself from your normal conditioned responses. There's a reason some traumatized people dissociate quite extensively as a way to cope with ongoing pressure – it works!

What's more: this shifts the meta-cognition, too. If you actually do dissociate from the experience, your actual experience is something different, it's basically trying to see yourself from the outside. This is so much of a shift from the original sequence of events that it's virtually impossible to also focus on what your inner state was like back then (you couldn't congruently do that while not being associated with your inner experience at the time), which means you are ""technically"" experiencing the thing from back then but without feeling what you felt, and to an extent even without seeing what you saw etc., because you're observing yourself (or even observing yourself watching the situation – it doesn't get much more dissociated than that) – the whole original chain of cognitive activity is just not happening.

So, you now have an extremely weakened form of the terrible waffle bite experience ""active"" in your mind – it doesn't seem like that would be any use, but apparently it is enough to get the reconditioning started: we have an entry point to the phobia close by.

Next, to actually transform the original phobic response, we need to somehow keep the ability to stay distanced from the old response but re-associate with the experience. That's where the super speed rewind comes in: you're associated but the experience is so scrambled (by reversal) and compressed (by the speed of the rewind) that it's difficult to get the original response fired up in your mind… and you barely have time to respond before the rewind is over. If you repeat the same thing again, it will be even easier because you've just practiced it – and only a smidgeon of the response popped up, so you already know it's much, much easier than facing your phobia head on. Another repeat and it starts feeling completely un-phobic and purely ridiculous.

Jumping through all of these hoops, we have basically forged a new chain of sorts: first we separated the experience from the phobic response, then we transferred that into an extremely distorted version of the original trigger – which is seemingly enough to make it work and attach this new chain consisting of ""experience the trigger – feel neutral or even a little silly"".

So, if anyone feels like they absolutely *need* to argue that the FPC is not original to NLP, my suggestion is you look at it as a particularly funky way to do external inhibition. Unfortunately, if you do this, you might start wondering if hypnosis isn't just external inhibition, too (particularly if you can agree with Erickson's concept of ""depotentiating habitual conscious sets""), and then you'd potentially end up concluding that all of hypnosis is ""just relabeled classical conditioning stuff"", too... and that would mean we could close down this subreddit because we've just been doing regular science things that everyone already knows about...

For the sake of this discussion, let&amp;#39;s assume the phobia developed because a waffle bit you and it was extremely painful (and let&amp;#39;s not talk about the fact that many people get bitten by waffles without developing a phobia, because then we&amp;#39;d have to face the fact that phobias are a little more complicated than this). The pain, then, is a biologically potent response, so it can serve as the UR. Then, maybe the bite is the US. It&amp;#39;s really the only thing I can think of if we try to map this whole thing out as purely Pavlovian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backward conditioning, in the only form that has been found to work more or less consistently, then, would require biting someone without having them see (or think of) a waffle. That doesn&amp;#39;t really look like a FPC to me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, we all &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to agree that there is something going on on a cognitive level, because classical conditioning is known to extinguish if you repeatedly present someone with the CS without the US going on. On a purely behaviourist level, only the bite could possibly be the US, but the phobia will keep going even if the person is never bitten by a waffle again. In other words, the conditioning that makes a phobia work definitely involves conditioning on a cognitive level (CS and CR are cognitively constructed), otherwise it wouldn&amp;#39;t survive a bunch of waffles that don&amp;#39;t bite. Now, if you want to argue that the FPC is essentially backward conditioning &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; on a cognitive level, I&amp;#39;m afraid that science doesn&amp;#39;t really back you up on that. There are solid findings for Pavlovian backward conditioning resulting in extinction, but not for &amp;quot;non-Pavlovian&amp;quot; (cognitive) backward conditioning – at least I could not find any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the FPC result in extinction? It certainly seems so! But not due to backward conditioning, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On FPC as &amp;quot;reversing pathways&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one I&amp;#39;ve seen several times in NLP materials. Basically the claim is that the temporal reversal magically undoes the existing chain of associations. I am entirely unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s assume for a moment that it&amp;#39;s true - that reversing a sequence somehow neutralizes the original from the mind, removing the energy and emotion and stuff. By that logic, if I&amp;#39;m a member of a band and I&amp;#39;m performing live on stage, I should probably never leave the stage again, because it&amp;#39;s the reverse of entering the stage! Next time I go on stage I won&amp;#39;t be able to feel the anticipation anymore because it has been neutralized. I may never again enjoy a stage performance...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that this is a ridiculous example, of course you&amp;#39;re right... but I think it&amp;#39;s just barely not-ridiculous enough to illustrate a little snag: reversals of sequences happen so often in everyday life that all of us would have noticed a significant effect by now if they were somehow magical. (To the people who have used VHS tapes – did rewinding a tape ever seem to unexpectedly ruin all the rewatchings for you?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#39;s try again...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; the FPC do? Recall that by my model, there are two ways to change a powerful association: somehow inhibit the existing associations (e.g. &lt;em&gt;external inhibition&lt;/em&gt; in conditioning lingo) or hype up the new association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t really any noticeable hyping up in the FPC, but there is an inhibitory element, and it&amp;#39;s the key of what makes the FPC work: dissociation (typically using the &amp;quot;movie hall&amp;quot; frame). By dissociating from the experience as it &amp;quot;plays out&amp;quot;, you distance yourself from your normal conditioned responses. There&amp;#39;s a reason some traumatized people dissociate quite extensively as a way to cope with ongoing pressure – it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more: this shifts the meta-cognition, too. If you actually do dissociate from the experience, your actual experience is something different, it&amp;#39;s basically trying to see yourself from the outside. This is so much of a shift from the original sequence of events that it&amp;#39;s virtually impossible to also focus on what your inner state was like back then (you couldn&amp;#39;t congruently do that while not being associated with your inner experience at the time), which means you are &amp;quot;technically&amp;quot; experiencing the thing from back then but without feeling what you felt, and to an extent even without seeing what you saw etc., because you&amp;#39;re observing yourself (or even observing yourself watching the situation – it doesn&amp;#39;t get much more dissociated than that) – the whole original chain of cognitive activity is just not happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you now have an extremely weakened form of the terrible waffle bite experience &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; in your mind – it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like that would be any use, but apparently it is enough to get the reconditioning started: we have an entry point to the phobia close by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, to actually transform the original phobic response, we need to somehow keep the ability to stay distanced from the old response but re-associate with the experience. That&amp;#39;s where the super speed rewind comes in: you&amp;#39;re associated but the experience is so scrambled (by reversal) and compressed (by the speed of the rewind) that it&amp;#39;s difficult to get the original response fired up in your mind… and you barely have time to respond before the rewind is over. If you repeat the same thing again, it will be even easier because you&amp;#39;ve just practiced it – and only a smidgeon of the response popped up, so you already know it&amp;#39;s much, much easier than facing your phobia head on. Another repeat and it starts feeling completely un-phobic and purely ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping through all of these hoops, we have basically forged a new chain of sorts: first we separated the experience from the phobic response, then we transferred that into an extremely distorted version of the original trigger – which is seemingly enough to make it work and attach this new chain consisting of &amp;quot;experience the trigger – feel neutral or even a little silly&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if anyone feels like they absolutely &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to argue that the FPC is not original to NLP, my suggestion is you look at it as a particularly funky way to do external inhibition. Unfortunately, if you do this, you might start wondering if hypnosis isn&amp;#39;t just external inhibition, too (particularly if you can agree with Erickson&amp;#39;s concept of &amp;quot;depotentiating habitual conscious sets&amp;quot;), and then you&amp;#39;d potentially end up concluding that all of hypnosis is &amp;quot;just relabeled classical conditioning stuff&amp;quot;, too... and that would mean we could close down this subreddit because we&amp;#39;ve just been doing regular science things that everyone already knows about...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
