I paid $2500 for what feels like nothing! I want to get over my depression and with 2 sessions left, nothing has changed. There is no life changing moment that was promised. 
I'm so mad at my coach, I felt that I have had no communication during this time. 

He's making me do this task that I write the perfect day for everyday. I write how I wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and blah blah blah. 350 minimum for the day. 

After I few days of doing this I get no replies from him tell me if I'm on the right track.
I've even wrote some ridiculous things in there to see if I get a response and there's nothing.

I have got to the point where I hate writing it and I've skipped days. I've had no emails asking why I haven't sent anything in. I email him and asked him if I'm on the right track and he replied that it was fine. I even replied that I hate doing this task and I got no reply.

I wanted to share this post as a way of making contact with other NLP students around the world so we can share information and grow together.

&amp;#x200B;

Here in Brazil, we have many NLP schools that teach distorted information. It´s very rare to find people that can stick to the original NLP models or at least add more quality to them without taking any information away (when teaching). As a result, we have a very poor NLP community.  


I have the opportunity to learn from Dr. Nelson Spritzer, PhD, here in my hometown Porto Alegre (@drnelsonspritzer on IG). He learned NLP and then trained with Richard Bandler's supervision for some weeks, so his model is splendid. Besides that, he was a Cardiology researcher for many years, so he is absolutely careful with the information he shares and has very good criteria to make his choices. He really is an example of what he´s teaching: a model of wisdom, health and good choicemaking.

I believe NLP can really impact the humanity in a good way. If people knew more about the way their unconscious mind works and the techniques to control it, we would really see our race have better results in many spheres: individually, colectively, with earth,... and others.

A few months back I tossed a idea around for a skype group, but I apologize I had COVID pretty bad, and my work/finances needed to come first at the time.

However, I currently have a lot of free time, and so I created a Hypnosis &amp; NLP discord.

The discord is only for practice/chat about NLP &amp; Hypnosis, and it is not for any promotion of products.

This is experimental, so come join and we can make it better together as we double our skill's :)

49,49,Intro to Self-Actualization | What do you need as a human being?,"When we think of our ‘needs’ most of us initially think of our 'lower' needs.

Our need food, water, sleep, exercise, money, etc.

But as human beings we also have 'higher' needs.  Our need to actualize our potential, our need to become the best version of ourselves, to express ourselves fully, our need to continually improve....  

These needs are just as real as our need for food and water --- they just operates in a different way.

As a coach, leader and/or someone interested in developing your potential this is an important distinction to understand.

The most famous model of self-actualization is Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs model where at the bottom of the pyramid are our survival needs, above that is security, and then social, self-esteem and at the top of the pyramid are these higher 'self-actualization' needs.

As human beings we start at the bottom of the pyramid at our survival needs and as we gratify those sufficiently we are freed to move up to the next level.

An example that I use to describe this is to imagine that you are under water holding your breath.

In the beginning it is likely that you can really enjoy being under water. You can relax, think about your goals, reflect on your life, and just enjoy yourself.

As time goes on however, as your lower need for oxygen remains ungratified, more and more of your attention gets pulled toward gratifying that need.

Eventually it can reach the point where someone could lose their sense of self, lose their values, and might even consciously or unconsciously drown another individual just to get some air because every single cell in one's body becomes devoted toward that one task — meeting that lower need. 

One of the amazing things about our lower needs is that the second that you get a deep breath of oxygen, air is the last thing on your mind. Almost immediately you are freed up to focus on other things in your life.

The lower needs work in this way. They unlock level upon level as you sufficiently gratify the level below: The less you have, the more you need them. The second you fulfill them, they completely drop out of consciousness.

This is not the same as how our self-actualization needs work. Perhaps surprisingly they work in quite the opposite way.  The more you get them the more you want them!

The more the painter paints, the more they want to paint.

The more the singer sings, the more they want to sing.

The more you express yourself fully the more you want to express yourself fully.

But there is a problem with this...

We are not able to visit in this 'higher' realm, let alone live there, until our lower needs are sufficiently gratified.

Every morning we wake up and we need to eat again. Every night we need to sleep again. Every month we need to pay our bills.

If you try to live at the peak without meeting your lower needs you will eventually burn out or need to divert your path. It is just not sustainable.

It is only when we have systems in place to consistently gratify our lower needs that we are able to free up our inner vitality to really focus on what it is that we are best at - what it is we are meant to do in this world.

Let's take a moment of self-reflection:

* How well are you meeting your lower needs on a consistent basis? Perhaps your focus could be on implementing strategies to meet these lower needs in a systematic way.

* Where would you say that you are currently living in terms of Maslow's pyramid? Are you more focused on survival, security, social, or at the top of the pyramid?   This self-assessment will give you a system for knowing what to prioritize for the next stage of your development.

* At what level are you focusing your vitality at this stage of development and is that aligned with your needs? For example if you are really focused on getting a relationship, but are unable to pay your bills you may want to reconsider your priorities.

In better understanding how our needs work we can gain perspective as to what our sticking points are and we can realign our priorities at each stage of our development to make ongoing progress towards unleashing our highest and best potential as a human being.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/mzvio1/intro_to_selfactualization_what_do_you_need_as_a/,NLP,t3_mzvio1,"Intro to Self-Actualization | What do you need as a human being?

The bump we ""have to get over"" when starting out, that feels awkward and how to tackle that. Not a guide, just talking bs about the topic. Coffeebreak-style.

&amp;#x200B;

Multiple endeavors I have are pretty easy and fulfilling once I get going and do it habitually for a few days. Then life gets in the way, I study for so long I forget what sunlights looks like and come out of my one-sided hermit-crab study-lifestyle after a few weeks - dumbfounded and confused.

&amp;#x200B;

* Today is the day I start fitness back up!
* Today is the day I continue my journal and goal-setting excercises!
* Today is the day I restart the meditation habit I had going!

But it feels weird and not at all as smooth as it used to be. Or when starting something new, it's a complex mess and I don't know where to start to get a pleasing, smooth and good result.

**What doesn't work at all** (I've tried) is working around the problem.

**What does work** ... at least the only solution ""to get back into the game"" I have found was to start where I am.

Starting up journaling or written excercises, I screw up the first page. Just writing it without coherent thought out plan or prettiness to it. Messy, unsorted and somewhat uncomfortable. Exactly how I feel towards the subject actually. Then out of that ... a more refined version emerges.

57,57,6 Models to Take Your NLP to the Next Level,"Want to go beyond the original NLP Models?  Here are 6 Neuro-Semantic models that will greatly expand your capabilities as a NLP Practitioner and Coach.

Model #1: The Meta-States Model - For Unconscious Communication
Beyond the traditional communication model of NLP the Meta-States model opens us to much more accurately track and transform the higher levels of mind, belief systems, inner dialogue, and all of the meta levels of the mind in a systemic and organized manner.

Acknowledged by INLPTA in 1995 as “the most significant contribution to NLP”, Meta-States model give us the ability to track back from someone’s behavior and representations up to the layers and layers of thoughts in the back of the mind that govern that experience all the way back down to our resulting behavior.

Model #2: The Axes of Change Model - For Change &amp; Learning
The Axis of Change incorporates the four key mechanisms for generative change – Motivation, Decision, Creation and Solidification. Not only does it create a structured framework for coaching conversations, but it will make your blind spots as a practitioner blatantly obvious and give you a clear path to expand your personal growth, coaching, and communication skills.

Designed for generative change, the Axes of Change Model results in change that is sustainable without the resistance and relapse features that characterize many other models designed for more remedial change.

This model dramatically transformed the way that I do coaching and is a powerful change model that I use in my sales process as well as to enhance all of my other NLP techniques.

Model #3: The Benchmarking Model – For Measurement &amp; Implementation
By its nature subjective experience is... subjective!

Would you like to learn a model that you can use to make intangible experiences more objective and measurable?

At its core the Neuro-Semantic Benchmarking model is based upon the ability to use the Meta-Model and to de-nominalize terms back down to their sensory based referents – but it takes this process so much farther.

In fact, this art has been refined over and over again in each competency based Meta-Coach Certification Training.

The practice of Neuro-Semantic benchmarking has massively transformed my ability to stretch my global-detail &amp; intuitor-sensor meta-programs with truly life changing consequences.

Applying this model allows us to take our outcomes, values, skills and experiences and make them measurable so we can better track the growth, learning and development of ourselves and those whom we work with.

Model #4:  The Self-Actualization Quadrants - For Self-Actualization
If you know me at all you know that in my opinion — Self-Actualization is the highest frame within which to practice NLP, Coaching, and Neuro-Semantics.  Self-Actualization is the larger frame from in which we can check the ecology of any system or change, and when we focus on unleashing the highest and best of ourselves and our clients everything else falls into place.

Model #5: The Matrix Model – For Systemic Thinking
The Matrix Model is designed as a systems model for thinking and working systemically with people, groups and organizations.  In Neuro-Semantics we use the Matrix Model for working with the multiple layers of meaning frames that create and describe the client’s world so that we can “follow the energy through the system”.

Starting with any external event, the matrix model allows us to track the process of embodying that information, processing that information, metabolizing that information into energy and embodying it into the state from which our behaviors flow out of.

We use the Matrix Model and its 7 matrices as a template for gathering and sorting information, for profiling, modeling, and working with the systemic complexity of human experience.

Model #6: The Facilitation Model – For Facilitating Change
When you coach/communicate with others (or yourself) do you tend to be too soft, empathetic and supportive?

Or perhaps you fall on the other side of the spectrum overly pushing and challenging in your communications.

The Neuro-Semantic Facilitation Model organizes the 7 core skills of Coaching/Communication onto the Meaning and Performance Axes so we can stretch ourselves as facilitators and take ourselves to the next level as agents of change.

Not only that, but it ‘facilitates’ you to find your perfect balance between being ruthlessly challenging and compassionately supportive.

When I first discovered this model I (like many other coaches) tended to be overly supportive in my coaching to the detriment of my clients.  Now I have the permission, capability, and experience of challenging my clients to take action and to stretch which has had dramatic effects in their (as well as my own) performance.

It was completely normal in that NLP culture for me to say something like “I just did NLP on him” or “She just did NLP on me”, or ""They just NLPed me"".

When I started learning/practicing Neuro-Semantic NLP one of the differences in culture was the shift from the focus on 'the process' to the focus on 'the person' and 'the relationship'.

Rather than practicing NLP 'on’ people, we practiced our NLP 'with’ people.

In terms of coaching relationships this way of operating supports me in building collaborative relationships with my clients in service of them and their desired outcomes.

It supports my clients to feel more empowered to take responsibility for their own results, increases their personal power, and it demonstrates as a role model a much more resourceful way of how to relate with other people.

With over ten years having passed since I shifted this way of thinking for myself I can say from my personal experience that doing NLP 'with people' has been much more powerful for me than doing NLP 'on people'.",1711

78,78,How I Built My Coaching Practice,"Are you starting your coaching practice?   Perhaps you have been coaching for some time now but still aren’t as confident in your skills as you would like to be, even though you are excited to share your tools with the world?

Recently I received a question from a client asking how I built my practice, and how I was able to build trust in myself and my skills.
Below is the first part of my reply...

To begin, I practiced at every opportunity I could. There are some skills where I needed to have someone’s permission and make it more formal of a coaching session, but there were also skills that could be practiced more informally and conversationally. 

For example, whenever I would be buying something I would practice basic rapport, listening, questioning with the person at the register. I would practice shifting the state of somebody sitting next to me on the bus, at the crosswalk or at the cafe. Any opportunity I got I would practice for free.

I asked anyone and everyone if I could practice X technique with them or do Y process to help them achieve an outcome.  

A basic script of what I would ask people was something along the lines of:
“Hi! I have been training as a coach and was wondering if you would be open to experiencing a 25 minute session with me. Worst case scenario things are exactly the same but we could potentially help you make a big impact in your life that otherwise wouldn’t have happened.  Would you be open to this?”

Or “Hey, I learned a process that could help you achieve X. Would you be open to experiencing this with me? It only takes 15-20 minutes. Worst case scenario you end up exactly the same but many people share that this has had a profound impact for them.  Would you be open to experience this with me?”

I found that having a time frame was important because you don’t want it to go on forever.  Whether it is 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour, I would invite people to experience free sessions with me and at the end I would ask them for their feedback.

* What did I do that you loved in that session?
* What was the best skill I demonstrated?
* What could I have said, done, or asked that would have taken your experience to the next level?

In fact, after 10 years of experience as a coach I still ask these questions after many of my sessions.  Honest feedback is one of the best ways to increase your competence. And if they share that they enjoyed the session, you can always ask for a testimonial and/or referral. If you sense that they got a lot of value you can also invite them to work with you more formally. 

If you are afraid to ask people out of fear of making mistakes, or have a hard time separating yourself from your behavior these resources may help:

79,79,New Here. Some Questions...,"My first question would be how best to absorb the information in NLP. It's a lot, even going by what's in the NLP For Dummies book. I'm familiar with the hypnosis aspect, but the rest is a lot for me to take in.

Second question... given what little I do know about NLP, I've seen a lot of information and techniques from a man whose material was required reading for a course I was taking. His name is Dr. H. Norman Wright. I'm wondering if anyone has any information on his studying NLP. His model of the brain, advice on building rapport, and even some techniques he shows on reducing stress, seem like they're based on NLP (one of his techniques I recognized as hypnosis), and he recommends hypnotic training like EMDR.

Third question... I've noticed that there are various ways to group together Milton Model and hypnotic techniques phenomenologically, such as yes/no sets and pacing/leading as a following phenomenon. Has anyone else noticed this, and does it make for easier learning?

80,80,Creating the Space for Your Coaching Clients to Speak Their Truth &amp; Open Up about their Real Issues,"I was recently asked by a client, “How do I build the rapport, safety and vulnerability in my coaching so a client can feel safe to speak their truths?”.

Beyond the basic NLP rapport techniques there are many coaching skills &amp; states that support this process which is so crucial to being effective as a coach.

AWARENESS OF THE CONTEXT My first consideration would be the context with which the person came to you. Did they come by choice? Were they forced to work with you? Did they come to you tentatively or with desire? Did they invest money to have this meeting? All of these factors will help determine the level of ‘rapport’ right out of the gate. The more desiring, willing, and invested they are as a general rule the more open they will be to share more deeply.

DEVELOPING YOUR SKILLS OF LISTENING AND SUPPORTING Most people are not aware of their ‘real’ problems’ or ‘real goals’ — or at least they aren’t very clear on how to communicate them. So they will test you with smaller problems/pseudo problems and see how you respond before bringing the ‘real’/’deeper’ issues to the table. How do you handle these?

Do you default quickly to giving advice? Or do you actively &amp; non-judgmentally listen, ask exploratory questions, acknowledge what you are hearing, check that you are understanding correctly, summarize what you have heard, etc. Do you separate out pseudo problems &amp; symptoms from the real issues and hear what isn’t being stated directly?

Do you call them out when you calibrate that they are being inauthentic, shallow, or playing it safe and invite them to get real? These skills will allow them to feel safe, supported, understood and build trust in your competence &amp; caring so they will be more comfortable to share their deeper, more meaningful issues.

DEVELOPING YOUR DEEP QUESTIONING SKILLS Ask deeper questions that pull them one level deeper than they have shared and see if you have resistance or if they follow your lead. In many contexts it is our job as a ‘coach’ to invite the deeper sharing rather than to ‘wait for it’.

DEVELOPING YOUR SKILL OF FRAMING Setting frames up front can help accelerate this process. Let them know that your conversations are confidential (because most of your clients refer their friends and colleagues to you or whatever reason is authentic to you). Let them know up front that you’re going to ask them deeper questions to get to the heart of what is most important. Let them know up front that the more real they are, the more real/authentic their results will be, etc.

What frames can you set at the beginning of your sessions/meetings that will allow them to feel more comfortable/help resolve some resistance they may be feeling to authentically share?

DEVELOPING YOUR COACHING STATE Lastly for now, how well do you unconditionally accept your clients? How well can you appreciate them as people and even appreciate their ‘problems’/parts of themselves that even they don’t appreciate about themselves yet? How much can you see them as a unique and sacred individual on a growth journey? How much do you put yourself aside and so they can sense it is all about them rather than about you, your ego, or you getting results. And again, how well can you ‘just listen’ and explore without the need to change anything. All of these things will support them in feeling safe and supported and accelerate the process of opening up. (All of these states can be cultivated more deeply in yourself with the tools in our State Elicitation course).

All of these skills and states will support you in your coaching to create the safe space your clients need to open up and discover the real and significant issues in their life that will create meaningful change to make your work so valuable they can’t help but actively promote and praise you and your work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/mm42pf/creating_the_space_for_your_coaching_clients_to/,NLP,t3_mm42pf,"Creating the Space for Your Coaching Clients to Speak Their Truth &amp; Open Up about their Real Issues I was recently asked by a client, “How do I build the rapport, safety and vulnerability in my coaching so a client can feel safe to speak their truths?”.

I've found the juicier, prettier and more visually pleasing the lists are, the easier it is to get inspiriation going. (Altough finding inspiration can be a huge time sink and an ever growing ToDo-List while nothing gets crossed of is a trap by itself \* \*cough\* \* reddit save post/picture \* \*cough\* \*)  


Also a morning coffee.  
I should (we all know what that word means in NLP) try to implement some body based routine like stretching. My flesh vehicle gets neglected often enough.

128,128,Thoughts on on my self-NLP challenges.,"     I was certified as a practitioner in June of 2020 and I decided to take some time to work on myself before I start working with clients.  Despite my best efforts I have had a hard time making changes stick.  Frankly, I have reverted on 99% of the change work I have done.  The only thing I have made stick was silly.  I renewed my taste for an album that I played out more than twenty years ago by mapping it across to something new and exciting.  (Pretty Hate Machine by Nine Inch Nails for those who are curious.)  As a result I finally got around to playing with something that my trainer called tasking.
      I haven't seen this discussed anywhere so I'm posting it here in hopes that I  can help someone to help themselves.  It was taught to me that getting the client where they want to be while in the session is on the practitioner but once the client is back out in the world the responsibility for staying there is on them.  This is where tasking comes in.  Tasking is assigning the client (of in this case, yourself) homework designed to keep them in the effective mindset that was created during the session.  In my personal case, I have a list of statements of intent on my closet door that I read multiple times per day with the intent of taking the meaning of the statement into my current state.  It's kind of like an affirmation however it works better than affirmations alone.  In this case, I have created a change with NLP and am using the statement of intent to reaffirm the change that I made rather than trying to convince myself of something by repetition alone.
     The second thing that I want to stress is for those who lean more toward the kinesthetic end of things.  When I talk about the statements on my closet door I mean that I write them in a way that I will feel when I read them.  Then, As I read the statements of intent I take a second to really dwell in how the intent of the statement feels.  Over a short time you will be better able to sustain the feeling for longer and longer.
     Third, even though it is taught that when mapping across, you map across the visual submodalities don't be afraid to try mapping across auditory and kinesthetic also.  Mapping across kinesthetic submodalities is how I got myself to enjoy Pretty Hate Machine again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/lsdj96/thoughts_on_on_my_selfnlp_challenges/,NLP,t3_lsdj96,"Thoughts on on my self-NLP challenges.

131,131,Loneliness - What triggers makes us actually think our social needs are not satisfied and how to change all of it (Discussion),"Inspiration was this video from kurzgesagt

[https://youtu.be/n3Xv\_g3g-mA](https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA)

Short-Synopsis: ""Like hunger, loneliness is a indicating pain that some need is not met.""

Then it gets into how loneliness can warp the individuals perception of social interactions towards ""She didn't like me""/""I don't belong""

&amp;#x200B;

So given the mighty sword of ""Your brain can't differentiate between real experience and thought"" that's on the core of many NLP-Techniques, is it possible to satisfy our inner hunger for social acceptance through NLP?

I've been toying around with this a lot, cause (I'm crazy) ... my social skills are not the best. So I have built many behaviors around this.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Structuring the inner world towards ""Nobody likes me"" - while searching for proof in the real world to justify that belief - is described in the aforementioned video.

Which is easy to do, since lots of social interactions can have something that can be misinterpreted and dwelled upon. Very easy to have resistance towards something and then gnaw on that one remark - that sounded like something your dad said to you when you were little - for the rest of the evening.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Restructuring said world towards something more healthy like ""Some people like me, some love me and a few find me attractive"" is a very doable endeavor and affirmation that triggers happiness in me. (Worked a lot on this, so I can swallow it somewhat without resistance. Tweaking the audio-submodalities towards a believable, pleasant voice was good here)

\_\_\_\_\_\_

The questions would be:

To which degree should we built our inner world of thoughts towards something that pleases us vs. changing the reality for real?

What would be the best way of changing our inner world towards the better?

Is one ever satisfied with their social interactions and feels constantly like ""they belong"" and ""are loved"" or is one never to be satisfied no matter how much external validation is given?

Meta-Commentary

    After this the post becomes more of a rant. The top part is the structured questions and talking topics I wanted to share.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My story here:

Thinking of loneliness as motivating social pain. Without it I wouldn't think much about widening or maintaining my social circle, since for me it's sometimes more work than fun. While I'm socially able and people want to hang out with me, it seldom gives me much. Which is also the main thing girlfriends have broken up with me over ""emotionally unavailable, like a robot.""

Makes sense, my dad has 0 friends - my mom likes the drama of people for entertainment and has a gaggle of girlfriends, but keeps them at arms length. They live for their business and only have each other (and their dog, which they adore). So my internal values are skewed towards the same ideals. Or as my first girlfriend described it ""Your family is the coldest I have ever met. Their not dementors in itself, but their presence sure makes the windows freeze over"" I did get two hugs from my mom.

So it's not completely frozen :D

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say the main hiccup with social interactions that leads to pain is resistance.

The breaking of rapport because the other has shown or said something that doesn't sit right with us.

Let's say my distant aunt goes on a rant about how ""Covid-Masks are bullshit""

I know she throws out this generalization of her beliefs, mainly because she can't just swallow the threat of covid. Covid restrictions destroyed her whole service industry business and she didn't have any income since 12.2019 and probably wont have any income till Summer. She's vicious and the tonality in her statement shows.

I would like to break rapport, cause simplifying it to ""Masks are bullshit"" doesn't sit right with me. I would like to get the statement right and bulldoze over her whole statement with ""the truth"" (my truth). But that doesn't get me anywhere in terms of rapport and social joy.

Leaving myself behind to go into her rabbit hole of frustration and anger would connect me with her, but I get a feeling of cringe and mini-vomit just thinking about it. Not really worth it

While I actually haven't talked to that aunt in 2 years. I have this exact problem in almost of all of my social interactions. Nobody fits perfect and my inability to be flexible, go into their world and be interested into going into their world causes me loneliness.

I have recognized that this is a problem in my life and are looking for ways to change this. Fiddling around with my inner world of thought and beliefs seems like a good start. Especially since forcing myself towards social groups is an ongoing theme in my life, which I dislike most of the time.

The only social situation where I listen like a hawk to what people are saying and are interested is the NLP Groups I managed in my city (Died due to covid :/). Luckily my job will give me enough financial freedom to travel to a bigger city and hopefully get a bigger NLP group going again after Covid subdues (2024 \*fingers crossed\*). So that's my current hope to get a social circle going that I share an interest with.

152,152,NLP and Anchoring Resourceful States Internally - Books/Best Ways?,"Hey all,  
  
After a series of panic attacks over the weekend because of noisy neighbors(which led my heart to physically hurt while I tried to sleep), I need some help on triggering a resourceful state. There's a number of situations where I can see myself needing this:  
  
* After work (when I'm burnt out from doing sales all day)  
   
* When I'm getting in the zone to run my small businesses, where I require some extra motivation to do a variety of work activities(speaking with suppliers, cold-calling customers, admin. work, tech. support, etc.)  
  
* When I need to be assertive, deal with confrontational tasks, or things that provoke my anxiety  
  
* When I'm going through a ""destructive"" state, like the neighbors making too much noise but can't ask them to turn it down any lower, or when I'm feeling helpless and repeatedly more angry (as mentioned) 

As you can tell all of this stuff is related to me internally. I'm not looking to guide others to entering a more resourceful state, I really just want to command it within myself, so I can better tackle obstacles of my life.   
      
Keep in mind that, having been in the sales industry for about a decade of my life already, I probably already have a basic background of NLP. I also work with a therapist who has an NLP background and explained some of these things to me, like pattern interrupts.  

* Are there any good books for working on this sort of thing?  
  
* Since I'm looking specifically to work on things internally, do I even need to read any longer books? If not, what are some guides, websites, blogs, videos, etc. that can be just as helpful?

As you can tell all of this stuff is related to me internally. I'm not looking to guide others to entering a more resourceful state, I really just want to command it within myself, so I can better tackle obstacles of my life.   
      
Keep in mind that, having been in the sales industry for about a decade of my life already, I probably already have a basic background of NLP. I also work with a therapist who has an NLP background and explained some of these things to me, like pattern interrupts.  

* Are there any good books for working on this sort of thing?  
  
* Since I'm looking specifically to work on things internally, do I even need to read any longer books? If not, what are some guides, websites, blogs, videos, etc. that can be just as helpful?  
  
* What are some ways where I can work on triggering a resourceful state?",1781

I find it quite difficult to pin down what I believe in. When I try, I become doubtful and ambivalent.

155,155,Not caring what others think,"Hi,

This is a life long issue for me...caring too much what people think about me. 

Has anyone body else had this issue and what was your methodology in dissolving it?

When I think about it, it shouldn't be about getting to a place where I don't care whatsoever about what other people think (sociopath) - ""over-caring"", in the same way Bandler uses the term ""over-hesitating"" for people who never get stuff done. Rather it should be about getting to a place where i don't care enough for it stop me from doing what I want to do, expressing what I want to express without fear, and feeling what I want to feel.

156,156,State management and submodalities issues,"Have you ever had an issue of not reacting to any of submodalities? Since I started NLP I had difficulties using submodalities on myself or controlling my state. During the courses, we were practicing some techniques in pairs but my colleagues often had problems trying it out on me, like swish, anchoring, circle of excellence or fast phobia cure. When its about recalling previous events, I just cant get my self into any of the states, positive or negative. I am still trying now and then, to slowly recall the images, smells, sounds or feeling but the more I try, the more it is for me to concetrate and recall any of those. In one moment, I was thinking I have some level of aphantasia. 

Maybe important to mention, there was also some traumatic events in the last few years, like deaths and accidents, but I didnt feel anything or had any phobias/traumas afterwards.

196,196,What are your go-to motivational techniques? (Here's mine),"I'm a big ""once I've started, I can't stop""-guy. But to get over the hump or analyzing why I've got trouble getting over the hump, I usually do this:

\- Chunk down

\- Make a mental picture of the end result and dwell on it for 7 seconds (enhancing it via sub modalities till it gives of a blissfull vibe)

\- Stare at the beast from afar and let the built up associations/inner dialog go through yourself consciously. Just bare through it with a cup of tea in hand. (In this example I look at the basement cellar until my mind starts to sort it out mentally how I could get a handle on things)

\- Usually staying conscious and aware is what does the trick  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Cunk down\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If I postpone or feel unmotivated:  
Mostly the task is to big in my mind an no clear path is set (Chunks are to big to comprehend/swallow)  
So I'll chunk it down and walk myself trough it on paper  


Example Task: Clean the basement

Internal Dialogue pre-technique:  
*""Jesus, where do I even begin. There so much to do and then the stuff I should sell on ebay"" - downward spiraling into demotivation.*

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Clean basement**

1.1 Take everything out of the room, starting with the one corner

1.2 Look at everything individually and sort it into categories

1.3 Take the easiest to fullfill category and complete it

1.4 Don't go into to much depth with big categories that feel like a rabbits hole. Just sort them aside for now (They have to be chunked down separately)

Most of the times there are good reasons why I feel unmotivated, but they are ""unconcious"" (Ignored and not really looked at eye value)",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/keuzlm/what_are_your_goto_motivational_techniques_heres/,NLP,t3_keuzlm,"What are your go-to motivational techniques? (Here's mine) I'm a big ""once I've started, I can't stop""-guy. But to get over the hump or analyzing why I've got trouble getting over the hump, I usually do this:

\- Chunk down

\- Make a mental picture of the end result and dwell on it for 7 seconds (enhancing it via sub modalities till it gives of a blissfull vibe)

\- Stare at the beast from afar and let the built up associations/inner dialog go through yourself consciously. Just bare through it with a cup of tea in hand. (In this example I look at the basement cellar until my mind starts to sort it out mentally how I could get a handle on things)

\- Usually staying conscious and aware is what does the trick  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Cunk down\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If I postpone or feel unmotivated:  
Mostly the task is to big in my mind an no clear path is set (Chunks are to big to comprehend/swallow)  
So I'll chunk it down and walk myself trough it on paper  


Example Task: Clean the basement

Internal Dialogue pre-technique:  
*""Jesus, where do I even begin. There so much to do and then the stuff I should sell on ebay"" - downward spiraling into demotivation.*

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Clean basement**

1.1 Take everything out of the room, starting with the one corner

1.2 Look at everything individually and sort it into categories

1.3 Take the easiest to fullfill category and complete it

1.4 Don't go into to much depth with big categories that feel like a rabbits hole. Just sort them aside for now (They have to be chunked down separately)

I recall this is related to the subconscious but looking at it from a very practical perspective.

Allow me to describe what I mean by that question, Sometimes we might be in a place and hear something, the brain/mind will correlate that room or environment with the sound or/and the situation, the next time we revisit that room we recall the incident.

How do we do that in the first place? How would you go about selectively disconnecting and connecting them?

I have noticed this happens when we look at trauma, by observing we start to disconnect the negative emotion from the memory or similar.

I am trying to understand more in detail how this happens and how to willingly make it happen both ways to develop certain good habits and of course help with getting through trauma. Practically and in a relatable way if possible.

While at it, I know memes are somehow related to this dynamic.  
Its also noticed on how we correlate words (them being symbols) with experiences which in turn form a language, I am curious about this too.

I have cause for concern regarding the toxic side of the self-development industry, its marketing towards children, families with sick children, and children with mental health problems. It’s application for ‘self-development’ that is being targeted towards children, as well as its use to treat medical conditions in children by those with no medical training or education; and alarmingly its encroachment into the school and classroom environments for both.

My hope is that this email will start a conversation with those who are best equipped to have it, so that the right action can be taken to ensure the welfare of all children.

There are a lot of people in this world selling snake oil, “cure all’s”, one in particular is N.L.P. 

N.L.P. is part of the self-development industry which is estimated to be worth globally $15 billion with nearly 6% average yearly gains. To put it lightly, people are making serious money from self-development. The selling of books, seminars online programmes, podcasts, blogs, live speaking events, and coaching are some of the mediums used.

This is potentially problematic because, put simply, people are more profitable to the self-development industry if they are unhappy and discontent, than they would be if they are happy and fulfilled.

In order to successfully market any self-development product, a sense of self dissatisfaction needs to be created in the prospective market or customer. In order to pull them in this is achieved by projecting a feeling of inadequacy. In turn, each piece of self-development material consumed, be it a video, book, seminar, webinar, or 1 on 1 session with a life coach, will give the consumer a sense of wellbeing, a small high. This high is caused by a surge in dopamine levels that rise in the brain.

This is incredibly dangerous because it can create an addictive cycle of behaviour. 

Self-development will make you feel good. There's no doubt about it. There's a feeling of satisfaction that anyone will have after finishing a self-development book, or after attending a seminar or coaching session, because these products are designed to give you a sense of motivation and accomplishment, especially in a group context where group social biases can make people vulnerable to the perceived inadequacies and insecurities upon which they are marketed to resolve. But that feeling of accomplishing something isn’t real because you haven’t actually accomplished anything other than consume a product that is designed to make you feel as though you have. Furthermore, that feeling of motivation, that bubble may burst due to external forces outside a person’s control, leading them to feel personally responsible for not having the success that was marketed to them, because they didn’t put in ‘enough hard work and commitment’ that you were told they needed to put in while their brain was flooded with dopamine. (Imagine this if you are suffering from depression, I’ll come to that later) Due to an increased sense of inadequacy this leaves people needing more and so the cycle of the consumption of more self-development material begins again.

The reason anything becomes addictive is not because of the thing itself. The reason someone becomes addicted to cocaine is not cocaine; it's what the cocaine does to the brain. It’s the rush of dopamine caused by cocaine that gets a user hooked. It’s the rush of dopamine that causes addiction. N.L.P. and other self-development products can cause pathological behaviour cycles by creating a dependency on the feeling of wellbeing triggered by dopamine. It does so by using social context and behaviour to turn people into a consumer of its products by playing inadequacy against success to create a false sense accomplishment and motivation that facilitates a dopamine rush, the high. N.L.P and other forms of self-development stimulate the same neurological and psychological mechanisms as cocaine.

In order to become an N.L.P. life coach or self-development guru I would suggest that you would have fallen foul to this kind of predatory marketing and in turn, in some way become addicted to its products and ideas. 

There are many N.L.P. organisations. I will focus solely on the ones I have seen that are aimed towards children that I believe to be toxic.

Many N.L.P. organisations and self-development gurus market the idea to potential prospective N.L.P. practitioners of being your own boss (are you sick of the 9 to 5?), financial freedom (do you want less stress?), success (do you need people to think highly of you?), all whilst helping children. You can do this after attending a course lasting only 4 days. Some even with one of those days spent on teaching someone how to set up a children’s therapy practice, and how to market their particular brand of N.L.P. as a franchise. Shockingly but not unsurprisingly there are optional add-ons, so after attending and successfully passing your short course, you can pass on your new N.L.P. skills to parents, and teachers.

Some of these N.L.P. and self-development practitioners take the opportunity to present themselves as a guru with promotional video testimonials from their ‘licenced practitioners’ praising them for their support and helping them achieve success, and finish as all new wave internet gurus do with “make the commitment”, “hard work”, “earn money” and “success”, with the offering of monthly private webinars and closed forums of N.L.P. and self-development content and not failing to subtly mention the financial commitment to your new guru to ensure your skills are up to date so you can acquire your next annual franchise licence for your successful N.L.P. business in what, on the face of it, appears in some instances to be a pyramid scheme.

Some of these N.L.P. and self-development organisations seem to blur the distinction between a medical licence and a franchise licence and sell the idea of helping children with medical conditions to potential practitioners who may then go on to think that because they are a ‘licenced N.L.P. practitioner’ and may already be a registered child minder, and have a clean police check; they can treat the symptoms of a number of medical conditions that could have their roots in all kinds of serious conditions that these practitioners would lack the competencies to diagnose.

One video testimonial I have seen, the new practitioner states they felt dissatisfied with the corporate world, so signed up to become a child therapist, and so applied to attend and after a 4 day course was a child therapist. 

In short you can quit your job at McDonald’s on Monday and by Friday be under the illusion that you are a ‘fully registered and licenced’ child therapist.

I struggle to reconcile the notion that it is possible to become a professional child therapist, regardless of whether or not you then operate in schools, but especially if you do, after completing a course lasting less than a week. I further struggle to believe that you can tell people that you are a licenced child therapist after completing one of these courses. I struggle more to believe that people who don’t have a degree in psychology or any medical qualification who are not doctors or professors are allowed to teach people to become a child therapist and give them the illusion that can work with children and in schools. 

It is my belief that this appears to actually be happening.

Schools, while having checks in place may fall short, because their child mentors and class support workers have a clean police check and are registered child minders and when they say they are a ‘licenced practitioner’, do schools realise this isn’t from a recognised medical training scheme and in actual fact issued by someone selling ’self-development’ franchises on the internet in an unregulated industry that the scientific community has dismissed due to its numerous factual errors and its lack of empirical evidence for effectiveness and recognises as pseudoscience. 

When it comes to diagnosing medical conditions, a medically trained professional, a Doctor, will, after many years of study, approach any patient with a degree of scepticism, and after rigorous investigation and the process of elimination rule out what things are definitely not, in order to find out what things may be, before narrowing down a diagnosis and then deciding on the correct course of treatment for a given condition. N.L.P. practitioners after a 3 or 4 day course won’t be able to do this, and would, with an unscientific mind, approach a patient with any given condition with flow chart diagnostics. They will look for certain symptoms that they could potentially treat with N.L.P. Once confirmation bias has falsely validated a condition, they would then apply their N.L.P. techniques to treat what they believe can be treated with N.L.P. 

Should they have accurately diagnosed a condition, blind luck will be interpreted as success.

Anxiety, O.C.D., A.D.H.D., Anger, Depression, , could all have social triggers, but are also symptomatic of other very serious conditions that N.L.P. practitioners would not be able to recognise with flow chart diagnostics let alone effectively diagnose or realise they should even be aware of after attending a 4 day seminar. As such, this could cause significant problems further down the line for a child with autoimmune disease, or perhaps a genetic condition like hemochromatosis, McLeod Neuroacanthocytosis Syndrome, Cushing's Syndrome (the list can go on) or in the worst case some types of Cancer. 

The symptoms of conditions these practitioners are treating could also be early onset schizophrenia. Schizophrenia causes all sorts of social and psychological symptoms because it is fundamentally a language disorder that in part robs the patient of the capacity to distinguish between their internal thoughts and the real world through something called ‘concrete language’. If you apply some one size fits all thinking techniques to a person (a child in this instance) suffering from this form of psychosis, the damage that could be done is catastrophic and potentially puts people, (children), in serious danger.

As a more frightening example, Depression (in its truest most destructive sense) is a genetic neurochemical disorder, that is as biological as diabetes, which through the impact of life experience influences, or perhaps just any way robs people at a biological level of the ability to experience joy. (Consider here what I mentioned above - that sense of personal responsibility for failure) Combine all this with people’s inability to distinguish the difference between being depressed and having depression due to semantic similarities and the social stigmatisms that further impact the psyche of someone who is already withdrawn and you have a cocktail for disaster. You can’t just sit them down and go through some thinking or social behavioural techniques and expect it to improve. This is because Depression, a neurochemical disorder, is in most cases a serotonin deficiency. This is analogous to sitting a diabetic down and telling them to snap out of it and hoping that in so doing their pancreas starts producing insulin. 

Depression is treated with professional therapy in conjunction with prescribed S.S.R.I. medication to trigger the production of serotonin in the brain. N.L.P. and other self-development products release dopamine. Neurochemically speaking this is comparable to treating depression with a cocaine habit. Children will report that they will feel better. Neither these practitioners, children, nor parents would be aware that they are actually not better and have in actual fact substituted a lack of self-worth, with a short term high, just like a ‘fix’. The damage that could be done here could result in suicide. This is because a patient with depression is at their most vulnerable from suicide when they are going through what appears to be a recovery; when everyone around them thinks they are doing well; after a period of psychomotor retardation, as they now have energy to take action on their self-destructiveness and self-harming thoughts.

I would suggest, the positive results that these organisations are reporting for treating Depression (as well as a number of other conditions) are in actual fact the result of a fallacy of composition biased by false validation because N.L.P. makes people ‘feel good’. In some cases children, sick children, who are potentially becoming hooked on the dopamine rush from consuming self-development products from an unregulated industry that has found its way into the classroom. I would further suggest that these statistics are in actual fact an alarm bell that should be seen as the number of children, potentially sick children, who are becoming self-development product addicts.

While the above may be extreme worst case scenarios, of which there could be more. Where more unnoticed damage could be done is in the realm of personality disorders and pathological behaviour.

Brain chemistry plays a huge role in personality disorders. ‘Messenger chemicals’ such as the previously mentioned serotonin are used in the brain to transmit signals between brain cells. Altered levels of serotonin have been linked to depression, aggression and difficulty controlling destructive urges. All of which some N.L.P. organisations wrongly target with their N.L.P. therapy which triggers dopamine.

In addition to this, if a person is overly sensitive to negative emotions and is neurotic, N.L.P. practitioners conditioning a child to avoid circumstances that may trigger negative feelings or reconditioning their thinking about these circumstances with repetitive self-affirmations reinforced with dopamine, could lead the child to develop a pathological narcissistic personality disorder simply because practitioner, parent, teacher or child wouldn’t be able to determine the difference between an angry child feeling better due to dopamine, and creating pathological behaviour models that will become malignant over time.

Are parents made fully aware that their child’s mentor, classroom assistant or even therapist; are offering or passively using potentially addictive pseudoscience from an unregulated industry for personal development? Furthermore do they realise in some cases offering this as a treatment for what they don’t realise is more often than not symptoms of autoimmune diseases or genetic disorder that require proper medical treatment? While these practitioners may have passed a police background check, and who are ‘fully licenced’, do the parents realise that these practitioners in actual fact have no medical training or education? Do parents realise they in fact only have a franchise licence from an unregulated industry issued after a 4 day course by a person; who in one instance that I have seen, who also has no formal medical training or education and holds only a certification in nursery nursing?

N.L.P. used by a psychiatrist with an advanced degree and understanding of psychology I am sure presents no problem what so ever. In fact there are numerous success stories about it positively changing people’s lives all of which are highly commendable but in these instances N.L.P. was applied by a trained any qualified psychotherapist.

N.L.P. in the wrong hands, like someone with no medical background having completed only a 3 or 4 day course is in my opinion reckless and incredibly dangerous. It is then being used to treat children’s medical conditions by people who are not qualified to know what they are doing. As well as being used in the application of self-development by exposing children to a potentially addictive cycle of consumption, that in the short term may make a child feel good, but in the long term may have catastrophic consequences.

The self-development industry could be seen as a community of individuals and entrepreneurs looking to better themselves. These life coaches could be seen as providing value by trying to make people’s lives better. I am sure some of them are. So where’s the harm? This is naive thinking when you're dealing with an unregulated industry that is worth billions that relies upon creating a sense of vulnerability and inadequacy to snare its practitioners that can then potentially be projected onto others to make a profit on potentially addictive products especially when they are marketed to children with medical conditions. In seems to me to be a pyramid scheme glued together by projecting social inadequacy onto the next person, so they can return a sense of affirmation.

It is my belief that there are people in The U.K. and quite likely elsewhere probably globally who have no medical qualifications, using potentially addictive N.L.P. techniques on children in schools. They have no education in psychology, they are not psychiatrists, and some have no medical qualifications. Some have only done a course only a few days long. Some of these people are treating psychological problems in children in schools.

I want to be clear, I am making no accusation of abuse against any individual, or organisation. There is no conspiracy, there is no malice. It is only my opinion that this is something that could potentially be harmful to children being committed naively by those who probably have the best of intentions, who are ignorant in their actions. This in my opinion has been allowed to take place due to an institutional failure that has let the potentially toxic side of an unregulated industry slip through the net and find its way into the classroom.

Please approach this with due diligence and care, children are involved, practitioners may have children, who could be exposed to backlash from sensationalist reactions. 

The self-development industry is unregulated, and that needs to change. Step one, get it out of the classroom.

307,307,Yesterday I Learned the depths of my programming,"Just as the header describes.. I learned the depths of my social programming when I couldnt enjoy the rain with my children. 

I have my 3 young ones ranging 14, 11, and 1. They love to play in the rain. In my quest for infinite self. I have started adopting this philosophy. I have ventured out into the rain randomly and stood in it a few times. Doing my best to relax and realize my connection with everything... But yesterday imo was one of the most eye opening experiences so far..

My children were outside playing in the rain. They invited me to come outside to join them. Of course i agreed. However, as the water hit me, I tensed up.. As every drop hit me, i stayed tensed as if i was gonna be in trouble for relaxing. I watched my children play and enjoyed watching them play. When the urge got too great, I would go back under the awning of our house and watch. A couple times the toddler would walk over to me and pull me back out into the rain. To which I followed, stomped in the puddles or let the rain hit me again for a little while. Only to return to the safety of the house after giving in to my subconscious. 

When I realized i was as soaked as i could stand myself to be.. I went inside and dried off.. Both feeling negative for not being able to stay outside longer and for not enjoying being outside with my children. I immediately start probing myself for the source(s) of my feelings and resistance to enjoy myself in such a simple situation. I  finally come to a concluding idea that Bc I dont deserve to enjoy the experience bc im not making the money or in the position I would prefer to be in to ""have fun"" Immediately getting upset with myself for this idea only to come to the realization that i have not yet changed this underlying belief about money. And Its a matter of learning how exactly to access and change this ugly belief i have in order to move up and onward.

314,314,BusinessCoach - Girlfriend is unhappy with her job - Want to do a coaching session with her - looking for ideas and good questions,"TL;DR Her job is amazing and very secure (Medical Studies), she ""hates"" it, but knows the benefits. i believe she has a bit of ""the grass is greener on the other side"", wanting to do something like a secretary job at a guitar shop or orchestra

**Her Job:**

*Her job - the best I can describe it - is looking through medical studies, foldering them into an everchanging sorting system, taking online-courses how the client want their studies to be sorted.*

*She has no medical degree or real understanding what she's sorting. (Not completly, but it suffices as explanation)*

*Then she hands it of and never hears from the study again. (She factually knows that her work helps or could help people, giving them hope to find a cure. But she usually never finds out if the medical study she worked on bore fruits)*

&amp;#x200B;

**What this post is about:**

We scheduled a ""Lets sit down and talk everything out"" for Saturday.I've noticed there are a lot of ""inner parts"" that built up animosity towards her job. Here are some I've isolated:

1. I don't see what I'm doing - (lacking the bigger picture or meaning)
2. The rules are always changing - Its frustrating - I need a job I can grasp fully
3. I feel like I'm not good at it
4. Maybe I'm not meant for it"" pointing towards her ADHD-like personality

She gets happy thinking about quitting her job, but knows a new job wouldn't hold up her current lifestyle money wise (Nice Apartment, money to spoil her cats) and ""It's a job you can get old in or get pregnant without a care""

She has a 4 day job and works as a guitarist for weddings on the side (which fulfills her, but she sorta knows doing that fulltime would mean stress)

&amp;#x200B;

**What kinda worked so far:**

""So the best would be having the same kind of money, but a simple job that has something to do with what you like .....\*looking for reaction\* .... or not working at all and still get money \*laughing and relief\*""

""Haha, yes the last part""

&amp;#x200B;

**What I tend to achieve:**

1. Disentangle the chaos of emotionally laden parts that argue against each other in her
2. Give her some relief with those emotions
3. Entwining stuff that has to do with her job ""It's complicated and frustrating"" vs. stuff she is projecting on the job ""I'm not worthy""
4. Laying it all out on paper. Making it comprehensible
5. Get boyfriend points :D /joke

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

The disentanglement of the different parts into graspable personalities is the hardest for me.

315,315,The Scarlett Letters,"Scarlett had gone through a lot in her life, and sometimes that happens just by being born in the wrong family. The utter nonsense that is spread in the personal development field, that we create our own destiny is more hurtful for people like Scarlett than it is for others. Yet like everything, utter nonsense might trigger negative emotions in us, like the guilt of not doing enough which leads us to do something and look for answers. That’s what happened with Scarlett.

After being mentally, emotionally, physically, sexually, and spiritually abused by people as close as the first-degree family, and as far as a taxi driver she met for the first time, or maybe by life just being mean because that is life sometimes, shit just plain happens. You can call it bad luck, and you can add to that the lack of opportunity to access a good support system that helps her create boundaries to protect herself.

We met for a couple of sessions, and her main answers to most of my questions were the following two answers:

· “I don’t know “
· “I am not able to”

So, I looked at her and asked the ever-annoying question: “ what's stopping you from knowing and doing whatever the hell you want to do?”

“Well, most of those who traumatized me are either dead, abroad, and in jail. Those who I still have access to trigger me so much I cannot even talk to them. And I have so much to say…”

“Alright then, you got to say them, Scarlett.”

""But how?""

“Well, you open Microsoft word, write a letter to each one of them. Then you open your email and send them to attached me. After you do that you delete the mail from your sent and trash folder. I read them and analyze them to know what we need to work on for you to start feeling better. When we start getting results, I will resend them to you so that you can read them from another perspective”

“But…. I can’t…”

""Why?""

“I harbor so many negative emotions, I might say a lot of mean and destructive things.”

“You do realize that you and I are the only ones that will read them, right?”

“That’s what I am worried about, you changing your mind and not helping me because of what I might say.”

“Yes, my feelings will be hurt when you express yours towards strangers, I never met that hurt you in ways beyond imagination.”

She cracked a smirk, and said: “Ok, I will try…. How much time do I have?”

“Can you send them tonight?” I said in a serious tone

“No way, I can’t, I need at least 10 days, I don’t know what to say, this is the hardest thing anyone ever asked of me…”

Interruptingly “10 days it is, to the hour, I have set a reminder to keep you committed to the second.”

She paid the coaching fee and left. She texted me a lot of questions and objections during the next few days, I did not respond. ( I later discovered from Andrew T. Austin’s work on the patterns of Chronicity, that this correlates to the first pattern that he calls “The 3 stage Ab-reaction”, and the best way to respond to a client’s negative emotion is not to allow them to bend your will with and stay on track you had in mind.)

One minute after the deadline, I receive the email from Scarlett with 15 attachments.

Without opening any of them, I delete the email from my inbox and trash, because that’s between Scarlett and them, and is of no business to me. From the following session, we started to get some improvement and result as she stopped carrying the unwanted weight of all the unsaid conversations to these 15 people.

Oh — I told her that I deleted the emails a year down the line, and she said laughingly “You asshole, but I wanted to see my drama, I was so looking forward to it, but I guess what’s in the past is in the past…”

319,319,PRESTO!,"  

Late 2011 I met Janet. Social Media had become a thing at the time, and this was in the days pre-NLP and Coaching as a profession, yet I had started reading and looking around the field. Janet and I became close, and she later introduced me to her best friend Mary one day, Mary was cool but I never saw her again for a while. 

One year down the line, Janet and I stopped talking for various reasons. A while later, Mary reaches out to me asking for something and a long friendship began. 

In 2017 Mary was meeting her fiancée at a Café and she told me to join. As we were there, Janet calls her and says she wants to join, since she hasn’t seen her for a while. It had been around 5 years since I last saw her, and I had been through the career change and had been coaching and training for 4 years. 

Janet shows up, surprised to see me, sat down and there was general chat for a while. She then looks at me and asks “Did I ever tell you that I have an extreme fear of Pressure Pots?”, I said no, but maybe someday we can talk about it more...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Commonly called Presto in my country as for the brand of Pressure Pots](https://preview.redd.it/0fqito9bb3d51.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=917e0f421b163e24c051915846a375324509e068)

Twenty minutes later, for a reason still unknown to me to this day,  I look at Janet and make the Pressure Pot sound: “Psssssssssss-PSHSHSHSH.” She looks startled and scared – side note, when Janet was young there was a civil war in her country, and the sounds of missiles were daily, somehow my mind connected that the sound of the missile is very close to the sound of the pressure pot (Presto) – I then tell her “Janet, a pressure pot is not a missile. It really isn’t.”

She laughs, looks at me confused, and said you know this might be the connection, and then proceeded to tell a story where she heard missiles on a specific day that left a specific impact on her. 

Two days later, I get a video on WhatsApp from Janet of her in the kitchen next to a pressure pot smiling. 

What I said could have been what really was the connection, or simply it was just a counterexample to what the fear meant to her up to that moment. Whatever it was – it worked.

Janet and I became close, and she later introduced me to her best friend Mary one day, Mary was cool but I never saw her again for a while. 

One year down the line, Janet and I stopped talking for various reasons. A while later, Mary reaches out to me asking for something and a long friendship began. 

In 2017 Mary was meeting her fiancée at a Café and she told me to join. As we were there, Janet calls her and says she wants to join, since she hasn’t seen her for a while. It had been around 5 years since I last saw her, and I had been through the career change and had been coaching and training for 4 years. 

Janet shows up, surprised to see me, sat down and there was general chat for a while. She then looks at me and asks “Did I ever tell you that I have an extreme fear of Pressure Pots?”, I said no, but maybe someday we can talk about it more...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Commonly called Presto in my country as for the brand of Pressure Pots](https://preview.redd.it/0fqito9bb3d51.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=917e0f421b163e24c051915846a375324509e068)

Twenty minutes later, for a reason still unknown to me to this day,  I look at Janet and make the Pressure Pot sound: “Psssssssssss-PSHSHSHSH.” She looks startled and scared – side note, when Janet was young there was a civil war in her country, and the sounds of missiles were daily, somehow my mind connected that the sound of the missile is very close to the sound of the pressure pot (Presto) – I then tell her “Janet, a pressure pot is not a missile. It really isn’t.”

She laughs, looks at me confused, and said you know this might be the connection, and then proceeded to tell a story where she heard missiles on a specific day that left a specific impact on her. 

Two days later, I get a video on WhatsApp from Janet of her in the kitchen next to a pressure pot smiling. 

What I said could have been what really was the connection, or simply it was just a counterexample to what the fear meant to her up to that moment. Whatever it was – it worked.

320,320,The Boy and the Nun,"  

Peter was 13. The school psychiatrist suggested to his mom that Peter starts on anti-psychotic medication. For any mom, hearing that was unacceptable and wanted to find other answers, so the psychiatrist gave the mom two months to find an answer to Peter’s problem or he will have to change schools because his reactions are influencing his classmates negatively.

Peter’s problem was that he was hallucinating a nun, visually and auditorily, VALAK from the movie The Conjuring, that caused him to have Panic Attacks, scream, and freeze. This had been going for 2 years on a daily basis, since his parents started the process of divorce. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Valak from the Conjuring or as Peter said from the Greek Bible as he never saw the movie.](https://preview.redd.it/znvn3qfstuc51.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=527cae99095e9506591531cab76eec170803d49d)

Peter’s mom, lets call her Julia had a friend who knew me, who knows I had the knack with experimenting with challenging cases. Although I am not a therapist, as a Coach and NLP Trainer, I have worked with challenging cases in collaboration with therapists for the better part of the last seven years, and got some interesting results as my frame of mind was different than theirs. 

Discovery Session, Peter and Julia come together. He shares his story and how long it had been happening. I deliberately misunderstood the name of the nun, and called her the name of a cheese “Kashkaval”, this is a PCW (Provocative Change Works) stance that helps in lightening up the mood and helping the client get out of his state a bit.

We did 4 sessions with intervals of between 2 weeks to 4 months in between and here is a summary.

Session One: We worked on changing the connection of the emotion to certain images in his mind. 

Result: He started seeing the Nun once every 2 days instead of daily

Session Two: Using the fast phobia model – we worked on changing a specific scene in his mind that started with the moment he started getting scared, and ended at the peak, towards starting way before the fear started where he was safe, and until he reached safety again after the peak.

Result: He started seeing the nun once every two weeks, but still believed it was out there not a figment of his imagination. 

Session Three: Mostly was a provocative conversation, getting him to think of different things in different ways. Two main points played a role here. His biggest trigger was when he was studying Maths and reached a point where he could not understand anymore. He was afraid to fail. So, we did a how to study Maths session a week later that was not related to change work, just a mental strategy session on how to solve problems. The second point was a question I asked “Have you ever taken a picture of “Crispy”?” The nun’s new name because her skin reminded him of crispy chicken. His answer was no.

Result: Two weeks later Peter sends me 3 Whatsapp Pictures telling me, that’s her, can you see, can you see? I asked where? Can you mark her for me so I can see her too? And the more he tried, the more it disappeared. And I did not hear from Peter or Julia for a while.

Session Four: Three months down the line, Julia calls me and says that Peter really wants to see you. We agreed on a date. Peter had grown in length, lost weight, and had asked his mom to change schools as he was not comfortable in the environment any more. When I asked about “Crispy”, his reply was: “Well I only saw her once, I was camping with my friends, and she showed up in the forest far away, waving her hand as if she was saying goodbye…”

That’s when I said goodbye to Peter, knowing that the best way to help someone change something is listening to how they create and maintain the problem, as PCW creator Nick Kemp says, and when heard well, change happens much quicker than expected and in much simpler more straightforward ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/hx80v8/the_boy_and_the_nun/,NLP,t3_hx80v8,"The Boy and the Nun

I'm curious how I can better practice and integrate certain things. Would love to hear from experienced NLP practitioners how they would recommend utilizing my time at work:

1. Body language: mirroring and matching. Assuming I'm standing, they're standing, and I have time to adjust my own posture as they input information into the credit card reader or sign, to what degree should I match (general upper body focus with limbs or very specific like, their ring finger is against counter so I match that)? when is it appropriate to match vs mirror? certain length of time to pause before matching etc?)
2. What are some examples of less obvious VAKOG expressions that I can notice and respond to in a complimentary way?
3. to what degree can I really practice this with limited time/openness from a customer? Many people will respond to questions and attempts to build rapport with silence or 'yeah'. Is this a 'lost cause' or are there subtle things I can pick up on to try to quickly engage?

*Fluff/Background text, no need to read:*

*We were supposed to hold 60min. Presentation in July. Due to Covid we are no longer obligated to hold the presentation, but I still wanna hold it cause my grade is garbage. But I'm missing some inspiration, since I haven't touched a NLP book in months and my original plan was to work closely with my co-presentations-people. Well, they've sailed ship and left me.*

*The class is a electrical engineering class. So I can basically make stuff up, since no one knows about NLP. The only thing I have to watch is that my political leaning is towards the teacher cause he's a bitch and wants ""All people happy together, corporations bad, grow your own vegetables, read books"". He's known for giving pupils bad grades if they hold different political views. Most hated teacher in the entire school.*

*- end of fluff*

The whole presentation should have been

Guy #01: Media - Wording and language in media and how it makes impressions on us. Keyword associations

Guy #02: Media - Manipulation through advertisment, tools to make a brand look appealing. Keyword framing

Me: Taking there stuff and pointing out tonality and auditive markers and working in how submodalities work

The full ""My presentation will be about""-guideline I gave to the teacher was:Submodalities - saving, retrieve, emotions, action- tonalities and auditive markers- submodalities and inner structure of memories

\- Meta-Models - Meaning of ""They are **all** idiots""

\- How arguments that are generalized ""All cats are nice"" mean ""The person believes &gt;50% of cats are nice, due to my experience"" and saying ""I know one cat that is nice, so your argument is invalid"" doesn't serve the argument. Which I take as a segway to ""What do you actually want out of an argument? Proving you're right and they're wrong or something else""

Okay, writing this out helped a bit. If this random word salad triggered some ""He could read about xyz, that was inspirational to me"" or ""Look at this youtube video to get back into the NLP headspace"", I would be thankful

362,362,How to get a solid understanding of NLP,"There are a lot of great books out there on the subject of NLP including hundreds of adaptations for every area of your life from dating to your career. Some popular books include: 

""Unlimited Power"" and ""Awaken the Giant Within"" by Tony Robbins - who has created a new technology out of NLP I think it's called Neuro-Associate Programming...

""How to Take Charge of Your Life"" by Richard Bandler - a somewhat easier to read, modernized version of ""Frogs Into Princes"" by Bandler and Grinder (founders of NLP)

""The Origins of Neuro Linguistic Programming"" by John Grinder

These are wonderful books that provide a great education on both NLP and self-improvement.

But...

As someone who went through a Richard Bandler certified Master Practitioner program, here are some of the things you will miss out on if all you do is read about NLP. And it is even worse if you are mislead by ""bad NLP"" information.

* You can miss experience practicing and drilling. Good NLP seminars implement the important factor of modeling and action. The original materials and people who contributed to NLP were constantly meeting up and documenting and sharing their experiences. Those experiences are much different than reading a book and testing out ""anchoring"" a couple days later at work. And it is best to practice after you've watched an expert put it to work.

** You won't learn to be dynamic nature of NLP and create unique patterns. There are a few very comprehensive and reputable NLP books like ""The Big Book of NLP"" by Shlomo Vlaknin that give you a good sense of how to apply NLP beyond anchoring, mirroring, and VAK. But NLP is hugely dynamic. And if you only read the basic books or reference random websites, you may not come to realize the full potential you have to implement it.

*** You'll miss out on the power NLP can have to affect people. I grew up with applying the scientific method to everything I did and I would say that made me a little too skeptical about most things. Or I would expect to see PhD level scientific research and data before I trusted something ""would work."" You can hear about how NLP can change people from books. But for me, there was nothing like seeing an expert NLP coach working one on one with someone and the effect it can have.

**** You only get a taste from reading. Reading is great and there are dozens of valuable books on the subject. Most of them go over the same or similar concepts, but rarely do the books go in depth about how to apply NLP to effectively help people.

NLP at its core is a communication and personal development tool. Communication requires people, and personal improvement is more effective when working with experts. 

Therefore, if you are fortunate enough to have an opportunity... 

If you want get a very strong understanding of NLP...

If you want to apply NLP beyond the basics to communicate better and help others... Practicing with people, with the guidance of an expert will be of huge value to you whether that is through a live training, seminar, or combination of digital and in person.

I was wondering if there's anything in NLP that works with emotional detachment. I'm kinda fishing for a solution to feel any positive emotions. My baseline emotion is flat and basically only experience the negative emotions and occassionally a laugh here and there. I've got some physical stuff that I thought might contribute to a lack of physical sensations of emotions, but then I thought that I could sense the negative ones so if I can physically experience negative emotions than I should be able to experience the positive ones as well right? I'm not depressed or anything, but there's just no positive emotions.

Anyways, its a lovely puzzle that keeps me going for one thing to another and repeat. So curious to know if there's anything on emotional detachment so I can see if that does anything :)

445,445,People describe their world - not reality (not mine),"TL;DR: I try to have more of an ""he talks about himself, no reason to defend my own world""-attitude in conversations. Lets explore their world

&amp;#x200B;

Example

Joe explains how every girl is a bitch. His emotions and therefore reality is true and talking against it is cumbersome and useless.

Metamodelling in normal conversations like ""Which girl exactly is a bitch?"" does work, but it gets the conversation on a logical boring level and denies the emotions of the other person. Sometimes they just want to vent.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using an extreme example here. In my circumstances its way more subtle.

 I have trouble accepting their world, cause in my consciousness floats the in-congruence with my world. ""Linda is not a bitch""

How do I forget my world and be more open to theirs?

&amp;#x200B;

Example

Joe explains how every girl is a bitch. His emotions and therefore reality is true and talking against it is cumbersome and useless.

Metamodelling in normal conversations like ""Which girl exactly is a bitch?"" does work, but it gets the conversation on a logical boring level and denies the emotions of the other person. Sometimes they just want to vent.

I'm using an extreme example here. In my circumstances its way more subtle.

 I have trouble accepting their world, cause in my consciousness floats the in-congruence with my world. ""Linda is not a bitch""

448,448,"Change your neuronal pattern sooner when you use Marijuana, is it really a shortcut?"," 

Hi,

My question might be more close to NLP but It might be more than that. That is why I make my question on a broader topic to see the validity of this statement.

By reading a lot of books in this field, I know almost 99% of the therapist, psychologist believes the neuro pattern shaps personality and you or try to make that change that personality in your self with beleive. It isn't true that it is a shortcut to get the same result faster when you are using a THC-dominate?

What I mean by that is, when you get high many thoughts are not disturbing and you can make a pure concentration in what you want and ignore everything else and not only making that person or abilities but believe in that person and get more in the details. Does it really have some impact on self-concerns or is this just a placebo or does not have effect

For example, When I get high I try to make my next version who is more listener and don't show a fast reaction to people. Then it starts in pure imagination and gets to the details without any thoughts from a different area of my life disturbing me.

\- I repeat this method a few times, and I have seen when I am not high at all. I am more calm and a listener.

\- Or I made a person who always made himself a breakfast or anything you want to be, and when I'm not high at all, I make myself breakfast,

I want to see is it true or fake statements?

HI everyone, I'm a bit of a lurker here.

I've heard good thing about nlp and how useful it can be(bandler, nlp gym and Steve Andreas 

My main goal is to learn state management and become more of an action taker. 

I've tried visualizations and affirmations with mixed success. 

I'm not trying to learn any persuasion techniques so far just techniques to induce change in myself. 

Especially when it comes to getting myself to do something that will benefit me. 
I usually do nothing no matter how simple, easy and safe the action can be. 

Ie make a phone call to the bank to see if my account is still working, calling my old boss for some information. 


Now this is the main thing I have to figure out and I have failed at it most of the time for the last 10 Years of adult life. 

I'm 29 and not exactly cash flush so I wonder if practicing on myself is enough to get me moving at least. 


I bought a couple books like core transformations by Andreas, get the life you want by bandler and a few others.

I have 8 hours of free time and a few books.

I don’t see my timeline, i visualize it (i mean i made it up). and my visualization is not good. I mean it’s too vague with little to no specific.
When he says do you see any blank or holes in your timeline, i don’t see if there is any or not.
I think so should be any and i visualize there is.
(My problem is i don’t know it is true or i just made it up in my head.)

My ability to recall memories is very low. 
My ability to visualization is very low too.

Then it'll probably be a LOT easier for you to build a bot that triggers on words a lot more associated with natural language processing! 

Maybe with a message like... ""Hey, did you try to find an answer that has something to do with natural language processing? Well, then this is not the right sub. This sub is for neurolinguistic programming, the human psychology kind. So... even though you're very welcome here, you won't find your answers here. Why not try r/naturallanguage? And feel free to return with any neurolinguistic programming questions you may have!""

Let me summarize all the good that you'd be doing here:

* You'd help your programmer peers find an actual answer to their question
* You'd help us coaches and NLP interessees a lot more sane
* You'd be our hero
* If you haven't yet, you'd find out exactly how to build a bot on Reddit.

Hey people.
I know techniques like 'mirroring' and touching people to build rapport but I hesitate to use them.

1. I don't like it when coworkers touch me because I know that it subconsciously makes me like them and I feel manipulated.
2. I don't want to manipulate people. I want them to like me because of my personality.
3. I don't want to get ""caught"" using NLP. Especially in a group I feel like people would notice my behaviour. 

What do you think? Do you use it to make friends or only in business?
Often when I am focusing on a person I like I start mirroring them without any intention. Walking in a group it also happens that I walk in lockstep with the person I talk to/ think about.
Has anyone experiences like this?

Hi, I've known and read about NLP for sometime but never really practiced it. So I'm starting to do it now in my life. I'm having trouble with this anchoring/trigger thing.

I want to create new habits in my life, but I don't know which NLP technique to use to do it (again, I'm new to this stuff, so certainly I don't know many of the NLP techniques available). 

Tried many Google on trying to find a NLP technique to create new habits, but only found results on breaking bad habits and making new, good ones, using the swish pattern. The thing is: some habits I want to do, doesn't necessarily replace any bad habits I'm currently doing.

For example: I want to make a breathing exercise that I only have time available to do during my commute to work. So, I want to create this new habit. Generally what I do in the commute to work is reading books or watch video tutorials, which are good habits that I don't want to stop doing. I need to create a trigger or an anchor to make this new habit and remind me to do it everyday and I need to feel good about doing it. I've tried alarms in my cellphone but they didn't quite work, because I'm not always at the same time in my commute to work everyday. I need to do it in a certain place. 

There's also this technique of comparing and modifying what you want to do, to something you would like to do. But I don't know if this is ""permanent"". The swish pattern has this thing that creates an trigger that makes things automatically and you've permanently made that habit stick (which worked really fine for me).

So can you use the swish pattern to make new habits (use the ""bad image"" as the image of you not doing the habit you want to do versus the image of you doing it) or there's a NLP technique to creating new habits?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/dr6492/can_i_use_the_swish_pattern_or_how_to_use_nlp_to/,NLP,t3_dr6492,"Can I use the swish pattern (or how to use NLP) to create new habits?

Welcome to the Champions Of Mind podcast - game changing content from the UK’s leading success, mindset and motivational coaches Llewellyn and Rhys Davies and James Burtt.

This week we had the privilege to have the Godfather of NLP here in Europe, David Shephard, on the show to share his three decades of business experience. There are not many people who have more expertise in the professional personal development space so this was an insightful chat about changes in business, systems of success and how the fundamentals of business still apply when starting a brand. David shared how he ended up as a Master Trainer, how he grew his business by cold called his way to gaining clients and how he delivered free training sessions to small teams to grow his skillset and reputation. We talk about value-based sales so it was great to hear that this approach has been the best way to build a sustainable business for 30 years!

644,644,Did my therapist try anchoring in my session?,"Hello there,

this might be a weird question but in hope that someone can help me I ask it anyway. I'm in psychoanalysis and my analyst is also a hynotherapist. We don't do hypnotherapy, we do analysis.

My analyst has a bell in his treatment room and I've always wondered what that is for. I believed it was for hypnotherapy. Anyway. So today I had a session and right before he walked to his armchair to start the session he rang that bell.  I couldn't see it, just hear it. So I thought he must've moved the bell by accident. But then just right after our session when he got up from his armchair he walked straight to that bell and rang it again.

I'm a bit confused now why he did that. Was it some kind of anchoring? What for? For me? For himself? I'm a bit confused and as paranoid as I am I'm afraid he's trying to do something covertly and manipulate me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/brd0ob/did_my_therapist_try_anchoring_in_my_session/,NLP,t3_brd0ob,"Did my therapist try anchoring in my session?

but from what i've seen over the years, NLP has become pretty badly diluted.  it's real stuff and it *can* work, but there are a lot of certified people who aren't very good.  if i was going to look for a training, i would approach it from a  skeptical standpoint; they would have to show to me that they're what i'm looking for.

648,648,Need name of floor exercise used to change a limiting belief.,"As part of a coaching education in non-English, we're taught a few floor exercises with a definite NLP streak to them, and I'd like to find some demo videos of two different techniques so that I can study them in my own time. I've been looking for a few hours, but I can't find videos of the exercises I'm looking for; and so I come to you all for help.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exercise 1** is a timeline exercise where the client defines a timeline on the floor and steps unto a scenario that will most likely happen in the future; a scenario where the client will need to draw from certain resources from the past in order to best handle that future situation.

Roughly speaking the exercise goes like this:

First the client is VAK'ed in the future scenario and the coach observes reactions. Then the client identifies a couple of points in their past where they had those exact resources. In chronological, backwards, order the client is VAK'ed and submodalities tinkered with to enhance the experience, and the client is anchored in turn for every past scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally the client is brought back to the point in the timeline where the client needs those past resources, the anchor is used, and the coach and client observe how the attitude and bodily reactions have changed towards the future scenario.

1. What is the name of that exercise
2. Where can I find video instructions so I can re-watch this as many times as I need?

&amp;#x200B;

**Exercise** 2 uses pieces of paper.

One piece of paper has a limiting belief written on it. The client steps unto the paper and recalls a situation where that limiting belief was evident.

Then the client identifies what other beliefs are needed to change the limiting belief, and those beneficial beliefs are written on new pieces of paper that are placed in a circle around the center piece of paper (the one with the limiting belief on it).

Then in turn the client is VAK'ed and anchored on the supporting beliefs in turn.  After every anchor the coach asks something along the lines of: ""what has already changed about your limiting belief?""

685,685,Will anchoring bring back a memory or a mental state?,"Hey.

I've been reading Way of the Wolf and Jordan Belfort talks a bit about using NLP and anchors to manage mental states of peak performance, but I'm slightly confused about the details of how this works. He says to anchor yourself with some sort of stimuli when you're at a state of peak performance to be able to bring that state back at a later time, but it's slightly unclear how exactly this happens.

He gives this example of an experiment with a dog, where they would ring a bell every time they fed the dog and eventually the dog would start to salivate just at the sound of the bell, but it's unclear whether the bell triggers a memory about food for the dog, whether it directly triggers a mental state of hunger or whether it triggers a mental state of hunger through the memory of the food.

I've been reading Way of the Wolf and Jordan Belfort talks a bit about using NLP and anchors to manage mental states of peak performance, but I'm slightly confused about the details of how this works. He says to anchor yourself with some sort of stimuli when you're at a state of peak performance to be able to bring that state back at a later time, but it's slightly unclear how exactly this happens.

He gives this example of an experiment with a dog, where they would ring a bell every time they fed the dog and eventually the dog would start to salivate just at the sound of the bell, but it's unclear whether the bell triggers a memory about food for the dog, whether it directly triggers a mental state of hunger or whether it triggers a mental state of hunger through the memory of the food.

It takes a very specific process to set up this physical trigger, but it is so effective. Whenever I’m walking into a group of people that makes me anxious I make a conscientious effort to press this trigger. I then immediately feel my shoulders and face muscles relaxing, I feel calm and improve my posture automatically. It makes me realize how tense I was, and really improves my social interactions and feelings of anxiety.

I use this technique where you associate an emotional state to a physical cue. I set up a specific movement, which is pressing my right hand thumb nail into my middle finger nail, and associated it with a confident emotional state that I’ve develop using a NLP exercise.

It takes a very specific process to set up this physical trigger, but it is so effective. Whenever I’m walking into a group of people that makes me anxious I make a conscientious effort to press this trigger. I then immediately feel my shoulders and face muscles relaxing, I feel calm and improve my posture automatically. It makes me realize how tense I was, and really improves my social interactions and feelings of anxiety.

So you have 3 layers of self that you can control. Your body, mind, and awareness (or consciousness etc).

Your awareness is the one to set the theme of what you want in life, your mind brings up thoughts according to the theme you set, and your body actually does the manual labor to move closer to your goals. 

For body improvement, practice is key. That's about it. Muscle memory and skills. Just basic stuff. 

For mind improvement, you need to see which actions get you which results. Plan for the future, plan efficiently, to achieve goals faster with new strategies. Thinking and planning and deciding HOW to do things. 

Awareness improvement is similar at a higher level, you can see which goals move your life in which direction, and the effects that your goals and strategies have on the whole thing. You can change the course of your life by deciding what types of goals will help you, and what types of goals will not help, and setting your mental state to be open to the good stuff and closed to the bad stuff. 

And thats about it. The way of improving every thing. If you have any thoughts or ideas to improve this please let me know!

772,772,[Please help] Can you use NLP to change mental associations with music and songs?,"I would appreciate any help because this can be really annoying and ruin my enjoyment for certain songs.

Basically, I have a type of synaesthesia where I associate physical locations strongly to music. One example is ""Drive My Car"" by the Beatles. When I hear it, it is strongly linked to a street near my childhood home. I don't necessarily think of the song when driving on that road, but when I hear the song, it conjures up mental images of the street.

And as you can imagine, I also associate songs with other things. I listened to Abbey Road heavily during a somewhat sad period of my life, so when I hear the songs I feel a little sad.

There are some songs I really like that are paired with mental associations or emotions I don't like. For instance, I really like a lot of songs by Muse. But last year, I had weekly appointments I needed to drive to. I listened to Muse a lot in my car during those rides.

But those visits were annoying. And they were often during the late afternoon (I don't like the late afternoon sun). So when I listen to the music, essentially I think of images and memories and feelings I don't like.

So, is there any techniques I can use to change these associations?

I really love music but I am afraid to listen to a lot of songs I like for fear of 'tainting' them irreversibly. And this happens in many other aspects of my life besides just music, so it sucks and it makes me frustrated a lot.

795,795,How to deal with misspelling/jargon out-of-vocabulary words with social media text when using word embeddings for CNN classifier.,"Hi, I'm relatively new to NLP and struggling with this issue. I'd love to hear your insights on how to best approach this problem:

**Context:**  
I'm working with social media text (sources include twitter, reddit, telegram and other chat rooms) that is related to cryptocurrencies. So if I use a pretrained language model (e.g. spaCy or fasttext) there are many out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words due to misspelling or crypto-specific jargon.

**The problem:**  
When a word is OOV, it has no embedding and gets passed as a vector of 0s to the CNN. Thus the classifier performs terribly on text with OOV word.

**Solutions I've played around with:**  
- Using auto-correct to fix misspellings (doesn't deal well with common misspellings like multiple duplicate letters ""moooooon"", doesn't deal at all with jargon words)
- Using character- or ngram-level embeddings like fasttext (completely misses the mark 90% of the time based on vector similarity and classifier performance)
- Train embeddings from scratch on text sources (prone to overfitting, poor performance on complex sentence structures)

I have an old friend which life changed entirely when his closest friend remplaces him for a girl . He considered him the only person on the world on which he could trust , he was the most important person of his life 

When his friend replaced him for a girl , the pain was so deep that his life changed completely . He became reactive on relationships , making his boundaries tougher and now each time he thinks someone will defraud him , use him etc. he tells them to fuck off , he can’t have any relationship anymore ( not with a girl I mean - but with anyone ) cause he doesn’t trust anyone , he controls people by making them to no talk to the guy that did that to him breaking some relationships , he can’t have any meaningful relationship anymore etc.

I tried a ton of things : made him realize that what he does is bad ( he said that if it makes it feel good then I don’t give a fuck ) , made him imagine that he could lose to meet another person that would change his life for good , made him realize that this happened only once and that there’s several billion of people in the world ( it’s the first time he trust someone like this ) etc, etc. But he doesn’t want to change , although , I just listened . Said once that what he does is narcissistic ( I was wrong by saying this cause criticizing him does no good ) but nothing more . Also said that the way he changed made me feel o sad  

He also has the belief that you can only have one true friend  . His most important value is to be there when things turn bad and also honesty 

Tried all this but I can’t help him , I really would like that he change his beliefs around relationships in general but I can’t , I also feel narcissistic cause I want him to change , even tho is good

822,822,Went to a NLP meetup - got the feeling I was being conned?,"Hi guys,

Just wanted advice from anyone who practices or is interested in NLP. I went to a meetup group, specifically titled ""How to get results with NLP"" and I am wondering if NLP is real/a type of therapy or if it's a con artist's wet dream.

There was a small talk with a guy telling us that we needed NLP in order to achieve our goals or desires and frankly, I didn't believe him. He kept saying that he would change the way we thought just by the end of the talk but I didn't feel any differently and he kept saying, isn't this worthwhile? NPL has great value to you, it will change your life. He was going on a lot about money too and how the DESIRE for money is the root of all evil etc. and it all seemed really irrelevant. I smelt a rat.

He ended his pitch with breakdown of his course program and it turned out that of course, inevitably we could sign up to his program today, only today and at a reduced cost of just £300 instead of the usual every day price of £3000. This consisted of over 100+ hours of 'homework' before we ever got to speak to him for our 1 and only one-to-one session over the phone. Then we would earn our masters certificate.

I was so disappointed. I felt like this guy was preying on the vulnerable. I felt like there would have been weaker people in the room than me who would have signed up and thought this was going to fix their problems. I also felt like there would have been people in the room who couldn't afford the £300+ and that it was their fault they couldn't 'fix' their lives or mindset because they simply could not afford to. Victim-blaming tactics.

Is NLP an accredited profession? This guy said he had been practicing for over 30 years and had professional certificates etc. but was he lying?

#### SCIENCE OF SUCCESS

# HAVING A TEAM MINDSET

## INTRO

As a Tulsa based Life Coach, Executive Coach, &amp; Business Consultant I have spent many years trying to discover “BETTER” ways of modeling successful ways of behaving and believing. When I was a kid, I had several different sets of parents and grandparents who helped shape my ability to realize that children can’t do anything right,

**anywhere**.

If the child, let’s call him Yames; if Yames behaves one way in one home, or classroom, it is perfectly acceptable and Yames can expect to be treated fairly or as all the other equally loved and respected people in the dynamic, BUT Yames can go to the next home or classroom and behave the EXACT same way and learn that the act is “selfish,” OR and this is the worst and most unnecessary guilt you can heap upon a young mammal who is trying to learn how to survive is to tell them their learned behavior is

“*evil*,” or “*mean*.”

When Yames acts or behaves in ANY manner, whatever the behavior is, when first began, it was most likely a ***learned*** behavior. Let me give you an example, the act of throwing a toy at the wall when someone was mad was introduced to Yames when he was already 7 or 8, far too late in development for him to have adopted a similar coping skill, but as Yames watched his new family hurl items into walls and floors whenever they would get upset, he knew that this was a destructive and seemingly juvenile way to process internal frustrations, but Yames could also perceive that this was not evil or selfish. It was all learned. You could trace it back to childhood behaviors which they could all clearly recall seeing acted out by a caretaker when questioned after the fact.

Last week, as I was jumping into my car to speed away to my next “thing,” I said something to a friend that pissed them off. I said,

&gt;“Hey what’re you guys up to this weekend? We should hang out or something.”

This casual invitation is a habit I picked up in my 20’s when I discovered that most people feel left out or unimportant to most other people. One friend was disappointed and crying to me one evening about how no one liked her or invited her to attend parties, she was mad at me for not inviting her along, and since I always want others to know that I am an open and inviting person who loves company no matter what I am up to and no matter what we are doing, I adopted a habit of inviting others along.

Well, last week, in order to follow my habit of inviting, I messed up and asked someone along who needed more intimate and specific plans because of a chronic illness which makes it difficult for her to commit to evening plans, which I did not provide and did not intend to provide as this was just as honest an invitation as it was casual. I just offer this casual offering to anyone whose company, I enjoy. I want them to know they are welcome to be around me anytime they get the urge and that I am easy to please with activities because the people who are there are the main reason I attend any event or do anything outside studying and reading or exercising.

This was when I learned about systematizing a powerful way of adopting a Team Mentality.

## BEING ON A TEAM

One thing football did positively for me was to help me learn what it means to have a role on a team and the goal of that team being bigger than any one role. The other factor I received from my days of colliding head to head with other hormone raging high schoolers was definitely brain damage,  based merely upon all the most recent studies. So, you might not be able to make these next few paragraphs to make any cohesive sense, but do try. If this starts to sound silly, don’t panic, we will get to a workable and applicable way to do this.

Being a Tulsa Executive Coach isn’t easy, one thing I started to realize was that our high school coaches never taught us how to play the game the wrong way; we spent all of our time rehearsing the Best ways to tackle, the Best ways to run, the Best ways to block, pass, catch, throw, and the list goes on and on, but here is the critical aspect of what I am sharing.: We didn’t focus on the wrong way of doing things EVEN when we executed the wrong way. The whistle would blow and we would hear,

&gt;“Line up. Run it AGAIN.”

We knew someone screwed up, but it didn’t REALLY matter who or what they did wrong, every man on the squad focused even more intently on their role and knew that focusing on executing your own role perfectly was all you could do to try to ensure that it would be executed perfectly. This was a great training system for me to apply to every area of my life. If something works; try to duplicate it.

## APPLICATION

In my own life, I found a way to look at my family like a Team. I recently discovered how amazing my family is.

No really.

I was always looking for ways to improve our

* quality of life,
* success at work,
* school,
* peacefulness, etc.

So, I would focus on what areas needed to improve and what we were doing wrong. I spent a decade being a really crappy Team member and an even worse Coach because I didn’t know I was on a Team. I wasn’t applying the successful model which took us from 1\-9 to 7\-3, losing 2 of those losses and our final game to the State Champs by a closer margin than any other team on their march to victory. We focused on the great attributes of our Team and we focused on executing the correct way. The best way. When we failed, we doubled our mental intent. We didn’t have time to wallow, the average football play lasts 7 seconds. You don’t get time to relive that mistake. Get over it, shake it off, and play like a champion because you are one as long as you don’t quit.

## CONCLUSION

We applied this model to our home. We cheer for one another and look for ways to do things correctly when we fail instead of beating ourselves or one another over the head with guilt and shame to try to rectify learned behaviors. Take a moment and see if there is a way for you to support those Teammates in your life that may not know they are your team mates. Give them an opportunity to feel what it’s like to be cheered for, celebrate their victories as if they were your own, and tell them all the great qualities they have and can use to achieve their goals and watch the floor of the whole village rise.

#### SCIENCE OF SUCCESS

# HAVING A TEAM MINDSET

## INTRO

As a Tulsa based Life Coach, Executive Coach, &amp; Business Consultant I have spent many years trying to discover “BETTER” ways of modeling successful ways of behaving and believing. When I was a kid, I had several different sets of parents and grandparents who helped shape my ability to realize that children can’t do anything right,

**anywhere**.

If the child, let’s call him Yames; if Yames behaves one way in one home, or classroom, it is perfectly acceptable and Yames can expect to be treated fairly or as all the other equally loved and respected people in the dynamic, BUT Yames can go to the next home or classroom and behave the EXACT same way and learn that the act is “selfish,” OR and this is the worst and most unnecessary guilt you can heap upon a young mammal who is trying to learn how to survive is to tell them their learned behavior is

“*evil*,” or “*mean*.”

When Yames acts or behaves in ANY manner, whatever the behavior is, when first began, it was most likely a ***learned*** behavior. Let me give you an example, the act of throwing a toy at the wall when someone was mad was introduced to Yames when he was already 7 or 8, far too late in development for him to have adopted a similar coping skill, but as Yames watched his new family hurl items into walls and floors whenever they would get upset, he knew that this was a destructive and seemingly juvenile way to process internal frustrations, but Yames could also perceive that this was not evil or selfish. It was all learned. You could trace it back to childhood behaviors which they could all clearly recall seeing acted out by a caretaker when questioned after the fact.

Last week, as I was jumping into my car to speed away to my next “thing,” I said something to a friend that pissed them off. I said,

&gt;“Hey what’re you guys up to this weekend? We should hang out or something.”

This casual invitation is a habit I picked up in my 20’s when I discovered that most people feel left out or unimportant to most other people. One friend was disappointed and crying to me one evening about how no one liked her or invited her to attend parties, she was mad at me for not inviting her along, and since I always want others to know that I am an open and inviting person who loves company no matter what I am up to and no matter what we are doing, I adopted a habit of inviting others along.

#### SCIENCE OF SUCCESS

# STOP NEGATIVE SELF TALK

## INTRO

When I was a child, my parents came to me and told me that they would be getting a divorce. I was heartbroken because everything I knew was about to change. I never felt responsible for the separation, however, I still did not want it to happen. I couldn’t control the environment I was living in nor could I control the changes that were coming.

All of this began to create a story within my mind that initially brought me severe internal conflict and emotional anxiety. Then, a story teller came into my life whose parents were divorced, and they told me that I would NOW be getting 2 birthday parties, 2 Christmases, &amp; 2 summer vacations; now, that person was wrong about how awesome it would be, but for a brief moment, someone told me that a terrible situation had a silver lining and I let myself believe it and IMMEDIATELY, my anxiety went away.

That small reframe was the start of a powerful Linguistic tool that has been the secret sauce to what I can do in an area where so many others battle and now I am sharing it with you to empower you to Be Your Own Hero.

## TELLING YOUR STORY

When I first learned that I too was a story teller, I had no idea what a mirror neuron was. I had no idea that I, along with many like me, was very literally able to shift the way people felt about their circumstances using vivid imagery &amp; by changing perspectives. Let me show you how this works. Try this along with me to see what I mean, most people are great at this and can experience this powerful tool Easily and Confidently.

As you read this now, you will begin to notice that there is a real and powerful internal energy welling up within you, and as that feeling now begins to move &amp; shift you’ll find that this perfectly normal, and you are safe and fine.  I’d like for you to allow yourself now to notice how ready you are to change the voice within to that more powerful and motivational pattern that you have been seeking. Use that energy within you now to generate all the strength and creativity you have to change your Story.

## THE POWER of YOUR STORY

Did you feel that? On a scale from 1 to 10 how intense was the energy inside you? Could you, if you focused your mind on it, increase that feeling?

As you consider the moments when you have criticized yourself and meticulously scrutinized your own flaws, I want you to consider what it would have sounded like to have someone like me very literally standing next to you and saying,

&gt;“Yes, of course you have faults. We all do, but let’s face the fact that you are pretty incredible, kind, smart, &amp; capable of achieving anything you set your mind to.”

Sometimes, if we can’t see our own story differently, it can help to imagine someone else who could see things differently and allow that story to play in our mind for a moment or two.

## ALLOWING ANOTHER to TELL OUR STORY

How would it have looked if every time you began to have doubts about yourself if someone like me were there to look at you and say,

&gt;“You have got this. I know you have whatever it takes, and I am so proud of you for giving it your all every single day?” “You are special and deserve to pursue what you really want.”

Would that have changed how you felt about you. Does it change how you feel about you, now?

There was a movie from my youth called SideKicks where the Protagonist would imagine or day dream Chuck Norris there to help him through difficult circumstances and situations. As a child, I was most fascinated with why he chose Chuck Norris, but the real lesson was burned into my mind: **Perspective.** Story telling is all about perspective. Barry, the hero in the movie began actually training, in his spare time, with a real kung fu master and because of the imagery and daydreams, he was motivated enough to fulfill the dreams in “reality.”

## CONCLUSION

Whatever you focus on in your story will become your reality. In fact, isn’t it true that even now, when you focus on the greatness inside of you, the integrity, work ethic, and memories from all those who have contributed to who you are, don’t you become overwhelmed with a sense of purpose and power? And this new perspective causes a new voice that you are beginning to hear now in your own mind which forces you to consider what your life would be like if firstly, in your circumstances, you began to see the greatness within you rather than the problems in your environment?

Use this technique of story telling to change the way you see your environment. Believe me, if you can dream it, you can achieve it. So stop the negative self\-talk and

845,845,NLP Anchoring and drugs,"*First and foremost, I would like to state that what I am asking is hypothetical. I have no intention to use drugs for this reason or any reason, nor do I promote the idea of using them on the basis of whether or not they may or may not be applicable in NLP Anchoring.*

I recently finished reading a book by the infamous Wolf of Wall St. himself, Jordan Belfort. Belfort discusses the importance of self-management, which I think we can all agree is vital in order to sustain a business. 
One thing that caught my attention and actually brought me to this subreddit, was his avocation of NLP. 

Belfort claimed that by triggering a certain sense during a point of 'absolute certainty', it would be possible to bring back that very feeling on demand. Of course this caught my interest. I mean, who wouldn't want to be able to recall a time that they felt unstoppable, whenever you want?

Belfort recommended a more niche form of NLP Anchoring, known as Olfactory Anchoring (anchoring via the sense of smell), as it the neural-receptors in the nose can be strongly attached to memory (..you ever felt a smell that took you right back to when you were at your grandma's house? - yeah, that kind!). 

What I'm hear to ask is whether a drug-fuelled state can be imitated (at least to an extent) via NLP techniques. For example, setting a relaxation anchor when high on cannabis, or an anchor of confidence and certain while on cocaine. 

Assuming it is possible, would placebo play a role in any physiological changes that may occur?

857,857,Focus on what you want,"Have you heard the expression 'Don't think about pink elephant!'? What do we find ourselves doing? - Thinking about pink elephants, of course. In order to make sense of the instruction, we first have to get a picture in our head of a pink elephant. So we have now done exactly what we have been told not to do, even though it wasn't our intention. That's how negative goals work, too. As we focus on what we don't want, inadvertently we are actually getting it.



Thinking about what you don't want is **problem thinking,** whereas thinking about what you do want is **outcome thinking.** Problem thinking arises when we focus on the thing that's happening now, which is, of course, the thing we don't want. So the only way we will change and experience more of what we do want is to move away from the present problem state and towards the compelling outcome.



There are two directions in life, forward and backwards, towards and away from. NLP was developed and focused back in the 1960s on successful people that were all 'towards'-oriented. They didn't waste their time and energy on what they didn't want but focused on getting what they did want.



'Away from' thinking focuses the mind on the present unsatisfactory situation that they want to change. When we try to get our brain to focus on what it doesn't want, it gets confused. Think about some of these goals; have you ever had goals like these?



&gt;'I want to give up smoking.'
&gt;'I must clean my room.'
&gt;'I've to stop eating junk food.'
&gt;'I hope I don't fail.'



Have you ever told yourself 'I mustn't forget to...' and then found that you did indeed forget whatever it was. Your brain is saying, **'Forget...'** whereas, if instead, you told yourself **'Remember to...',** you'd have a lot more chance of being successful. It happens sometimes with children, doesn't it? People say, 'Be careful don't fall!' and then they do just that. It's because subconsciously they've heard the instruction to fall and they've focused on that word.



When people are focusing on the problem and being in a problem state, there can be fear about what they'll do when the problem's fixed. What will they focus next? Will there be a void in their life? Some people worry that they are no longer worrying about this thing. This is another very good reason for focusing on something enjoyable, something they do want or who they want to be.

### THE WORD 'TRY' IS THE ENEMY OF SUCCESSFUL GOAL-SETTING

It is simply a variation on problem-state thinking. The word 'trying' implies that you doubt whether you'll be successful but nevertheless, you're going to put it out there as a goal. By using the word 'try' no one is convinced you mean it, so you won't get any support. How hard are you trying really? It sounds as if this is a goal that you think you ought to have because someone else has suggested it, or you have read a book or blog post that recommends it, so you're going to give it a 'try'.


Instead, remove the word 'try' and replace it with the belief that's important. It's something you do want to do, so start picturing how success would look. If, when you do this, it isn't that compelling, then change your goal to one that is.

Trying does not form any part of goal-setting and doesn't belong there. Instead, word your goal in the positive as something that you will be or get and take responsibility for achieving it.

### I WANT...

As part of your personal development, start thinking about what you do want in every situation.

Even, for example, when you're shopping and you're looking for a parking space, think in terms of 'I want a parking space' that than 'I bet I won't get a parking space.' Amazingly, it has been proved that people are more likely to get what they desire (yes even parking space) when they focus positive energy on what they want.

It's not just about what we say and how we think, it's the way we live our lives and what we notice. When we notice what's going well - the good decisions and choices we're making and the steps we're taking along the road to our goal - rather than pouncing on the disappointments and false moves, we will find ourselves closer to our goal.


### When, How, Where

Apart from wording your goal in the positive as something you do want, you can also orient yourself toward getting it by adding in words like 'when', for example. 'When I am fit, I will...' or 'When I have passed my exam, I will...' Add to this by building a picture of how you will look and where you will be. Can you get an image in your mind of yourself in the future?

People who are able to picture themselves as a leader; manager and powerful influencer within their organization start working towards this role by dressing the part, networking and impressing those they need to impress. They not only want to see themselves in the role but they also want others to picture them there.

When you talk about that time in the future when you will have achieved your goal, you make it start happening by talking as a different identity. Someone wanting to become healthier eats and behaves differently from someone who has a goal 'trying not to eat the wrong sort of food', and people wanting to move up the career ladder make sure that their work is done to deadline and that they behave in a way that shows them in the best possible light.

When you talk about your goal like this and take on the new identity, it starts to become your reality. Your future is already becoming your present. There is no question in your mind that you will achieve your goal, as using the words 'If I get fit, I will...' would suggest. When we think in terms of 'If I achieve my goal...', it suggests that there is some doubt in your mind that it may not happen. It also firmly places you in today's problem state as opposed to being on the way to a future where your goal has been met.

### **TLDR;** Focusing on what we do want rather than on what we don't want is a matter of thinking first what we really want, imagine what it will be like and taking it on as our identity. This moves us from a state of problem thinking, where the focus is on what we don't want and moves us toward what we want.

Now, before we get started, I need you to take a moment or two and imagine an activity which you are able to do very well. It could be anything, as long as you know for sure that you are excellent at it. Can you Bake a lasagna, are you an athlete, a host, a caretaker, a friend?
THINK now and really picture that activity which you know you are absolutely great at achieving. Now, the feeling you have when you picture yourself doing that action well, that feeling that you feel NOW is the mentality of a winner and the exact mental state that you must really be able to generate before we move on to the first step of this FAST \+ EASY MIND SHIFT STRATEGYTM. So, if you have been intentional and if you feel bold, continue.

**BODY**


Now, as you read these words, and now that you know that you have established a safe and clear mental state that makes you feel empowered and ready to engage with this successful solution to this little issue we can begin. First, imagine yourself entering your favorite movie theater. If you do not have a favorite, it doesn’t really matter, but you must feel safe, secure, and the imagery of the theater must be vivid and real to you. As you smell the buttery popcorn wafting through the air, you may stop by the concession stand and grab a beverage or candy selection before entering the actual auditorium where we will pick our favorite seat. Did you make a selection? What did you get?

Jolly ranchers, skittles, snickers, twizzlers, or traditional popcorn, get whatever you like.


Ok, great! As you find the perfect seat in the theater, you will now notice that there is a room at the back of the theater where the projector for the film is, that room is also for you; when ready, you will control when the movie will begin. The control room is entirely run by you, when you are ready to begin, however, it is important that you only visit the control room IF you need to see yourself watching the memory for any reason, but otherwise you will relax, get comfortable and control this video of your memory from your seat.


As you look around the empty and yet cozy theater, pick your favorite seat and settle down and relax. As you now begin to notice the lights in the theater dim, you will begin to see a movie play out on the screen in front of you. You’ll have to squint a bit because the image is extremely small on the screen in front of you; as you adjust your eyes, you will begin to be amused as you see that the fuzzy, black and white picture is a movie of your memory. The small film is a picture featuring you as the HERO, but it is also of the FEAR or PHOBIA that we are about to eliminate. This is the event that occurred that started this series of emotions. Good. Now focus. The events on the screen will play at normal speed but there will be a few important differences; instead of the feelings we would normally feel, we are now going to layer a comical audio file over the top of the film. There will be no elaborate or scary sounds in this movie, other than humorous ones; be sure to use a laugh track from a sit com or your favorite funny theme song; I use THE OFFICE &amp; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and play this over and over again to drown out the sounds of the original memory.


***Note: Occasionally, as some people have engaged with this image, they have felt overwhelmed by the thought of watching this memory play out; focus and relax, we have a solution for this as well! As you breathe steadily and peacefully, you can take a moment and drift back to the control room where you can watch yourself bravely facing the film of your fear. As you face your fear, now is a good time to encourage yourself and tell yourself how proud you are of yourself for facing this issue.***

Now, as the film ends, it is time to take our power back from this memory. As we process how much better we already feel, the movie is over and the reel hums as it comes to an end. As this happens, we are going to stop the movie of our memories on the last frame.Now, look at your face on the screen and step into that body, you will now run that movie in reverse at 2XX the original speed as vividly and colorfully as you possibly can until you arrive back at the start. Fast, QUICKLY, RUN IT ALL THE WAY BACK!
GOOD!


**CONCLUSION**
Now, as you look into the eyes of the new you, the you that has conquered that mental image that you had, how do you feel? Do you now feel freedom, joy, and peace? GREAT!! That means that you have completed this technique and you can live a life of confidence and victory over a minor issue that used to hold you back in some capacity.

861,861,HOW TO GAIN CONTROL IN 3 STEPS | NLP | SELF HELP | JAMES PESCH,"HOW TO GAIN CONTROL IN 3 STEPS
2018-03-21 | James Pesch | CPT NLP
HOW TO GAIN CONTROL in 3 STEPS
 
INTRO
How many times have you wished you could gain more control? What comes to mind first? As you think now about the time or times you have wanted control, which events rush into your mind fastest and could have turned out better for you? Now, that this imagery is clear, what do you mean by
 
“GAIN CONTROL?”
 
I immediately picture an aircraft pilot plummeting in a random spin toward earth. The pilot, with sweat pouring over his lips into his grit teeth, I know that his mission is to GAIN CONTROL of the craft; we ALL know the pilot is successfully able to GAIN CONTROL as he manages to handle the situation &amp; save the maximum number of lives and prevent as many casualties as possible.
 
STEP 1
As I describe this scenario, you may have your own idea of what it means to GAIN CONTROL of a situation pop into your mind, this is PERFECT! Use your scenario NOW; the main starting point for this technique to work is

Find, create, or invent VIVID and emotionally stimulating IMAGERY and mental avatars like the scenario I just described that give you strong associations with what it means to GAIN CONTROL. For me, this is often reflected in those we see as HEROES
 
 
FIREFIGHTERS &amp; PUBLIC SERVANTS 
TEACHERS &amp; COUNSELORS
DOCTORS &amp; NURSES
RESEARCHERS &amp; SCIENTISTS
WARRIORS &amp; MARTYRS

 
STEP 2
Use the imagery to create a mental scenario. Think and focus now while you begin to use these examples to draw a bridge of correlation; some call this METHOD a parable or analogy wherein you find a way to make your actual situation you are living out (relationship, career, habits, anxiety, etc.) and then you simulate the imaginary scenario to demonstrate to yourself what it would look like for you to be your own HERO, and see yourself GAIN CONTROL over the situation similar to the Pilot/Plane scenario WHILE drawing an emotional correlation to your specific circumstance.
 
2. Connect and correlate the specific outcomes that would demonstrate why you as the pilot of your situation would benefit from being able to GAIN CONTROL, and what the results WILL BE once you do. As the plane hurls toward the earth and everyone on board panics, SEE yourself remain calm and collected, you, as THE pilot, are the ONLY one who is capable of successfully being able to GAIN CONTROL now and you know that you are qualified, strong, and confident that you do have the right answers even if you can not control the outcome fully.
 
As you now begin to see yourself able to right the craft, and with all your strength and courage, you are able to do whatever it takes and grab the control stick and land yourself and everyone else safely, don’t you NOW begin to see how your life will improve and how much easier it will be to GAIN CONTROL of any of your situations once you realize that ONLY you can?

 
 
STEP 3
Finally, How will your life improve once this issue is resolved?!
Whew!
The plane has been landed, by you! CONGRATULATIONS!! You were able to GAIN CONTROL of your situation, and fully create the imagery you need to overcome those fears that use to limit your ability to GAIN CONTROL. Now, that you have done this for your situation (relationship, career, habits, anxiety, etc.,) How has your life improved?
 
3. Focus on the end goal and successful scenario where you were able to be your own HERO and GAIN CONTROL of your situation. Create clear and vivid pictures of the lives which will be changed and the improvements you will feel as you begin to use this FAST &amp; EASY MIND HACK to GAIN CONTROL of this situation. What does it look like now that you have been able to GAIN CONTROL in this area?
 
BE SPECIFIC as you begin to write down exactly how your life will improve.
 
 
CONCLUSION
That’s it!!
As you begin to use this FAST &amp; EASY MIND HACK to GAIN CONTROL of THIS situation, you may find a strong desire to use it for other areas in your life that held you back so here is a summary of the 3 steps!
Find, create, or invent VIVID and emotionally stimulating IMAGERY and mental avatars like the scenario I just described that give you strong associations with what it means to GAIN CONTROL. For me, this is often reflected in those we see as HEROES.
Connect and correlate the specific outcomes that would demonstrate why you as the pilot of your situation would benefit from being able to GAIN CONTROL, How do you know you do need to GAIN CONTROL? BE SPECIFIC.
Focus on the END goal and successfully completed scenario where you were able to be your own HERO and GAIN CONTROL of your situation. Imagine what you will look like, how you will feel about this, and how others will be affected by this positive change.
Great! If you engaged intentionally then you are finished! If not, do it 3 times from start to finish each time connecting more with being the HERO of the scenarios. I highly encourage you to look for more ways to incorporate this POWERFUL technology in other areas of your thought life; also, I do this full time and am available if you have trouble with mental imagery or need scientific data or resources to learn more about how these and all my MIND HACKS work so fast and effectively!

There's various sources I found and various websites, but when I visit the website, I'm often greeted with a site that does not look legit, or a website that is down, or a website that seems not to reflect the power of NLP in the website's construction itself.

It's like I have to sift through a whole bunch of garbage, filter it all out myself, and *maybe* come out the other side with something useful to use in my life.

&gt;*How to GAIN Trust using ""Cold\-Reading"" and ""Barnum Statements""*

Everyone uses ***Barnum Statements*** from time to time, but only the greatest communicators and salesmen learn the Psychology behind Human Behavior and the Language that determines the way we FEEL toward others.

Barnum Statement:

&gt;*“Deep down you know your own self worth, however you find that often you are far too critical of yourself and this limits your confidence in many areas.”*

 See, how that sentence seems like it is specifically and uniquely designed for ***you?!***

## It wasn’t. 😉

 Imagine walking into all your future meetings, dates, or emergency scenarios equipped with a secret that would make you the most

##  ·       Trusted

## ·       Influential

## ·       Confident

## ·       &amp; Persuasive

person in the room.

 As you begin to see yourself walking into situations with incredible power and control, this unique gift will endow you with inexplicable favor and success, which area of improvement in your life is the most significant?

 Which situation matters most and which one will change the most in your life once you learn and implement these 4 methods into ALL future social interactions?

 NOW, you can excitedly and with great focus, as you realize and notice the exact scenario you will apply this to for massive growth and optimization, continue.

##  MIND SHIFT STRATEGY (MSS)™ 4 STEPS to use Cold-Reading to Gain Trust

##  1.    Make Statement Personal 

STEP 1: USE “You” &amp; Exact Words provided by your audience

This seems to be common sense, however, most people have no idea how to do this naturally and powerfully, so pay attention closely.

Let me ask you a question. How often do you pay attention to the manner in which others introduce themselves? Has anyone ever made you feel incredible about yourself by remembering your

### ·       Sign: Libra, Scorpio, etc. . .

### ·       Name: If they say “Christopher,” Don’t say, “Chris.”

### ·       or detail: Wife’s name, Pet, vehicle, clothing, etc. . .

Did this person seem like it was difficult for them or as if they were searching for a way to connect or manipulate you, or did their compliments and admiration of you and your talent flow uninhibited from their soul? Focus. Others are incredible. You can see their wonderful and impressive qualities. Say it, casually, and intentionally. Make sure you are heard, and then begin phrasing opinions using “YOU” statements ie

 “You often find. . .” or “You, like most, probably. . .”

##  2.     Use Sincere Language

 STEP 2: UTILIZE Sincere Language

Use words like ***“Feelings,” “Deep down,” “on the inside,” “Honestly,” “Personal”***

Examine your audience closely, \(this works best when you begin working with a single, captive and voluntary audience.

As you focus now, on sitting across from another human, imagine trying to comprehend not what the other person is thinking but what they are feeling. When we teach mirroring techniques, we teach our practitioners to try to feel what others feel by mirroring their body language markers.

&gt;***Posture*** *– If they are leaned back and appear relaxed, so do you; likewise, if seated forward and more engaged in anticipation, mirror this posture*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Eye Contact*** *– Some people love it, some hate it, mirror whatever they prefer*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Limbs*** *– If they are crossing their arms, have hands in pockets, legs crossed, or fidgeting, mirror a similar mannerism as casually and naturally as possible.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Words*** *– I can not stress this enough; use their words, EXACTLY. If they say they need to relieve “Anxiety,” then you use that exact and sincere word. If they state that they are looking for an affordable solution, then you find and deliver the most “AFFORDABLE,” solution you have, etc.*

## 3.     STEP 3: USE Vague &amp; Ambiguous Language

     STEP 3: Use words like “Rarely, Sometimes, Occassionally, Often, etc.”

Most people are totally ok with words like Most, Often, Rarely, Usually, because although they appear to be leaning toward one end of a behavioral spectrum, there is still plenty of room in these words for cognitive relativism. Most of us can find ourselves agreeing with someone who is opinionated but leaves much space in the conversation to be themselves entirely incorrect about their opinion, that is why these words have a tendency to be useful in building emotional rapport.

There are certain words which do NOT allow for this cognitive space and distances others from our perspective or words:

&gt;***NEVER USE “NEVER;” ALWAYS STAY AWAY FROM USING “ALWAYS”***

\(unless the audience volunteers “Never or Always,” just don’t.

##  4.     Step 4 Create an Out: Offer a double bind option

STEP 4: Offer The Linguistic Double Bind

Many expert and human behavior specialists develop subtle and savvy strategies to get the result they want in conversation by offering an out in the way of a double bind.

##  For Parents: ""You’ve been very well behaved today, would you like to go to bed at 8:00 or 8:30pm?”

## For Sales: “As someone who is obviously, honest and transparent, like myself, would you rather disclose the budget you are working with, or would you just like to move forward to the pricing options we are currently offering?”

## For Cold-Reading &amp; Barnum Statements: “I can tell you are someone who is smart and that causes you have a tendency to hide details from others, however, once you establish trust, you’ll find that you are quite open to sharing your deepest thoughts.”

##  CONCLUSION

As you now begin to use these 4 FAST \+ EASY Steps to increase your own influence, pay it forward and tell others about your ability to optimize your success and future relationships &amp; share this article with as many people as you can.

 Visualize the impact you will have on your social circle and the ways you will be able to help those around you by making them feel incredible about themselves and take special note of the ways this will change the level of influence you begin to experience in your day to day life.

905,905,The Four Agreements: Best way to be spoken,"Hi all-- noobie here. 

I have limited experience with NLP, having been to a workshop at one time and working with a couple practitioners in 2009. 


I have read and reread the book The Four Agreements and love them. However, I am wondering if the way they are written/said is counterproductive.


I believe Numbers one and four are okay; 
(1) Be Impeccable with your Word 
(4) Always do your best.  


Its numbers two and three I am concerned about. 
(2) Don't make Assumptions 
(3) Don't take anything Personally.


I have read, and from what I remember, our mind doesn't hear ""don't'"" so these would translate in our mind as ""take things personally"", &amp; ""make assumptions"". 
 

Is this accurate? If so, what is a better way to state these two agreements for myself?

936,936,Creating Characters to combat motivation issues,"**Summary**  
I've developed a method for my own use that utilizes acting, to help with motivation and procrastination. Characters are created and developed that have certain aspects that you need in your life. Such as a character may be extremely work-driven and loves tackling monotonous work tasks. Or perhaps they are extremely studious and love absorbing themselves into a college textbook. You then, essentially, act or pretend to be the character. When done right, and with practice, you are willing your mind to treat a situation differently.  

It may sound simple and silly, but there's quite a bit that goes on behind the scenes with getting this to work, and uses some basics of NLP behind how it works.
_____

**Background**  
The inspiration behind all of this stemmed from a podcast I listened to at complete random, of Sir Patrick Stewart in a casual interview. During the interview he explained that for his live plays, in which he'd often perform the same show multiple times a day, he used a technique to keep it fresh each time. This is far far far from verbatim since this was a while ago that I listened to it, but he basically explained that he used a trigger to 'become' his characters.  
For one show, entering onto the stage through a doorway, when he touched the door handle he would become his character fully--and that character was fresh. So even if he immediately performed a second show, the character he assumed was a fresh version of that character who had not yet experienced everything that happened in the previous show. This made everything that happened in the show new and exciting for him.  
He explained that it allowed him to not get drained from the shows, and kept it from feeling monotonous and like he was just on repeat over and over again.  

As I was listening, I immediately was fascinated. I began to think of how this could be used in many other formats. How it could help *me*.   

I suffer from severe motivation issues and depression from the results of my lack of motivation. (Yeah, feedback loop) The logic was pretty sound for what Sir Patrick Stewart was doing, especially after I discovered NLP (Which was a few months after I began developing this), and how the brain could be manipulated into experiencing things.  

This can also be used to improve yourself as a whole, or certain aspects about yourself. Such as confidence or sense of adventure. While you're using this as a trick to start off with--sort of 'fake it till you make it', it goes deeper in that over time you're instilling good habits regarding the aspect of your life. So even though you're just pretending now, they eventually become a part of you (Should you want, anyways)  

I began creating a method that used Sir Patrick's own play acting method, which has developed significantly over time.  

Basically, you create a character or multiple characters that you will act as/pretend to be that character for whatever duration you need. I know it sounds silly and too simple to be true, but despite how simple it sounds, it can be remarkably effective. You'll be not only developing your ability to do this over time with practice, but also developing your characters over time so that they are more believable, relatable, and easier to get in character for.  

If you're interested in this, or giving it a try, I thought I'd share what I've created. I don't know if something like this already exists or not, it's just something I came up with over time. Hopefully someone will find it useful!

What do you want to improve? Make a list of what your goals are. I'm going to detail all of my own examples for reference, in all of this.  

My goals that I wrote out:  
Motivation for work, chores, and to keep myself in good health.  
Higher sexual libido.  
Higher affection.  
Confidence.  
Studious.  
Curious about everything--engaged in learning.  
Engaged in discovering my faith/beliefs.  
Able to ignore tiredness/get second wind  
Stop snacking throughout the day.  
Healthier meal choices.  

That's quite a few goals... Depending on how many goals you have, you may want to create multiple characters. Honestly, it's just harder to have a single character take on 6+ significant traits. It's more effort on your part to keep all of those traits in check when you're using the characters. So please consider making multiple characters.  

I have three. Corie, Elle, and Elspeth.  

You'll be developing these characters over time, so start off simple. Just the names and what traits they embody, and perhaps a few general personality traits to make them more 'human'. It doesn't matter what gender they are, just make whatever characters you want. All three of mine are female, not really for any good reason. You're basically creating characters like you would for a novel/short story.

Corie: Motivation for work, chores, and to keep myself/herself in good health.  
	-No nonsense, extremely caring, motherly in a somewhat strict way. Cares more about 'my' wellbeing far more than the other two.  
Elle: Studious, Curious - Engaged in learning, Engaged in faith/beliefs discovery.  
	-High energy, whimsical, outgoing.  
Elspeth: Higher Sexual Libido, Higher affection  
	-Pretty laid back, sexually adventurous, loves attention romantically/sexually (Doesn't really care about normal social attention, and in that way is rather introverted.)  
Traits shared by all three: Confidence, Second Wind, No Snacking, Healthier Meal Choices.  

Why some of the traits are shared by all three:    
Confidence - they each have confidence in their own way. Corie is business confidence--no nonsense, doesn't really care what anyone thinks. Elle is a free spirit and, again, doesn't really care what anyone things and doesn't care if people judge her. Elspeth believes she's attractive and hot shit, so there's no being ashamed of her body or appearance, but she couldn't be a public speaker like Corie...unless drunk.  
Second Wind - They're each their own 'entity'. When they're being used, they're using their own minds, not my tired/bored one. So switching alone gives a second wind.
No Snacking and Healthier Meal Choices - They all eat purely for sustenance. Elspeth loves herself some wine or beer, but that's about it.

**Using your Characters**  
Some of the terms I'll be using for when you're 'acting' or 'pretending' to be your characters will be Assuming, and Imposing. They're better terms imo for this technique than either acting or pretending.   

It's good practice to try using one of your characters at least once a day, so you're practicing. It takes some getting used to, so the more practice the better.  

Getting started, I suggest you use a trigger. It can be a word, phrase, or my personal favorite: a physical gesture. Decide on a trigger for each of your characters. My trigger for Corie is to, on my left hand, put my middle and ring finger together with my thumb at their tips. Then slide my thumb down the two fingers, and back up to the tips.  
(It's possible to do this without any trigger at all, but I suggest doing it with a trigger. It'll create a much more stable and reliable foundation for you)  

""But where am 'I', in all this?"" When you're characters are imposing you, 'you' may be either just somewhere in the back of your brain, observing, relaxing, or just kind of in 'off' mode. Or if you have an imaginary place/landscape (sometimes called a wonderland or mind palace), you may be off in that location doing whatever. It's really up to you. If you have more than one character, you may be off chilling with them somewhere.

To develop your trigger, you'll need to put it to use numerous times. Use your trigger, and then immediately after, pretend that you are your character. Believe it. You are your character. Feel their emotions, feel their drives to do what they were intended for. If they were meant to be highly motivated for work, feel their need to get started working.  

_____

**Development**  
Don't just do the trigger, feel the character, and then let that be that. USE your character each time you activate the trigger and assume your character. You're establishing your ability to be that character too, and to maintain it. Doesn't need to be long, especially if you don't really need them right then and there. But just do it to get a good feel for them.  

THINK like them. They are their own person. Their own thoughts, feelings, opinions that may vary from your own. When your characters are imposing you, go all out. Think as they might think. This will also further develop them, making them more solid in your mind and easier to use. They're like your own little brain babies. (Okay maybe not, that sounds weird)     

Yes, you'll feel silly starting out. Doesn't matter! Do it anyways! No one will know anyhow.     

To give an example, when I first became able to use Corie for a couple hours at a time, I spent the time as Corie, having a conversation in her head with Elle, Elspeth, and 'me' all at the same time. Let your characters talk to 'you', when they're in control. This will help develop them.  

Even when I don't need to use any of them, I'll sometimes have conversations with one or all three while I'm browsing reddit or playing games. It's kind of like having an imaginary friend in your headspace. (This is also how these may eventually become tulpa over time.) It's great entertainment, at the very least. Other people also *can't* hear inside your head to know how crazy you sound having conversations with made-up characters.  

Eventually, if you really start using your characters and doing everything, such as talking to them, fully behaving as them when they're 'imposing' you, they will develop over time. Their personalities may become much more diverse, like an actual person. More complex. This is great! It means that they're growing for you, becoming more lifelike and relatable. You'll become more accustomed to them, their thoughts, emotions, feelings, and it'll be so much easier to assume them.  

Now all three of my characters are way more developed than the original outline of them I listed above. They're intricate and complex characters that are easy for me to assume when I need them, because I'm now so familiar with them. At this point, they each have their own appearances too so that when I'm 'talking' to them, I can imagine what they look like. Corie is the most developed, since I need to focus most of my time on work at this point in time in my life, but Elle and Elspeth will be getting more attention once I'm in a better work place (Which is improving because of Corie!)  


I'm happy to answer any and all questions. :) And please let me know if you try this out!",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/6sgame/creating_characters_to_combat_motivation_issues/,NLP,t3_6sgame,"Creating Characters to combat motivation issues **Summary**  
I've developed a method for my own use that utilizes acting, to help with motivation and procrastination. Characters are created and developed that have certain aspects that you need in your life. Such as a character may be extremely work-driven and loves tackling monotonous work tasks. Or perhaps they are extremely studious and love absorbing themselves into a college textbook. You then, essentially, act or pretend to be the character. When done right, and with practice, you are willing your mind to treat a situation differently.  

It may sound simple and silly, but there's quite a bit that goes on behind the scenes with getting this to work, and uses some basics of NLP behind how it works.
_____

**Background**  
The inspiration behind all of this stemmed from a podcast I listened to at complete random, of Sir Patrick Stewart in a casual interview. During the interview he explained that for his live plays, in which he'd often perform the same show multiple times a day, he used a technique to keep it fresh each time. This is far far far from verbatim since this was a while ago that I listened to it, but he basically explained that he used a trigger to 'become' his characters.  
For one show, entering onto the stage through a doorway, when he touched the door handle he would become his character fully--and that character was fresh. So even if he immediately performed a second show, the character he assumed was a fresh version of that character who had not yet experienced everything that happened in the previous show. This made everything that happened in the show new and exciting for him.  
He explained that it allowed him to not get drained from the shows, and kept it from feeling monotonous and like he was just on repeat over and over again.  

As I was listening, I immediately was fascinated. I began to think of how this could be used in many other formats. How it could help *me*.   

I suffer from severe motivation issues and depression from the results of my lack of motivation. (Yeah, feedback loop) The logic was pretty sound for what Sir Patrick Stewart was doing, especially after I discovered NLP (Which was a few months after I began developing this), and how the brain could be manipulated into experiencing things.  

This can also be used to improve yourself as a whole, or certain aspects about yourself. Such as confidence or sense of adventure. While you're using this as a trick to start off with--sort of 'fake it till you make it', it goes deeper in that over time you're instilling good habits regarding the aspect of your life. So even though you're just pretending now, they eventually become a part of you (Should you want, anyways)  

I began creating a method that used Sir Patrick's own play acting method, which has developed significantly over time.  

Basically, you create a character or multiple characters that you will act as/pretend to be that character for whatever duration you need. I know it sounds silly and too simple to be true, but despite how simple it sounds, it can be remarkably effective. You'll be not only developing your ability to do this over time with practice, but also developing your characters over time so that they are more believable, relatable, and easier to get in character for.  

If you're interested in this, or giving it a try, I thought I'd share what I've created. I don't know if something like this already exists or not, it's just something I came up with over time. Hopefully someone will find it useful!

939,939,"Creating and Utilizing characters to act as, to conquer motivation issues.","Hi all! So I'm extremely new to NLP, but stumbled upon it *after* I designed a method to fight procrastination and motivation issues with myself. I've only known about NLP for a couple months now, and haven't done much reading into beyond super light stuff.  
It only just struck me a couple days ago that what I've been doing might actually be linked with NLP. To be honest I don't know enough about it to say for certain if it is or isn't. I'd love to know if this can in fact be considered NLP, but if not, please let me know! 

So basically, I've created three characters that each serve a specific purpose in my life. They each represent qualities either of myself, or that I wish to have myself, in perfect quantities. Their ultimate purpose is to continually develop them and utilize them to, in an acting/power-of-imagination sense, impose my body. So when I need the one that is extremely hardworking to push through work motivations I'm having, I'll force her personality to impose my own. I am no longer myself, I am instead her. My self is off floating around in the brain somewhere, enjoying the relaxation of doing nothing.  
These characters are continually being developed in detailed ways so that they are believable, relatable 'people' which causes them to become easier to 'use' as time progresses.
It's worked extremely well so far, and results are improving over time and with character development. Mileage may vary depending on how much effort you put into the start of each 'imposition'.
 
Inspiration for this method: Interview with Sir Patrick Stewart's in which his stage acting methods was talked about.

It's a method I've been developing for a while now, but have never heard of anything quite like it before. I'm really curious if this sort of thing already exists. Since this is something I just came up with, it would be nice if there was already something already developed so I have additional help designing it. There's SO much more detail about all of this, but I'm being intentionally brief since, again, I'm not entirely sure this counts as NLP in the first place. I'm still fresh little newbie with only a vague understanding of it. If anyone wants more details about any part of it, I'm happy to answer.
